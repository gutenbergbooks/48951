<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">THE FIRST DAY.</span></h2>


<p>&#8220;O, dear, dear! Who set this basket
down on my white apron? All wrinkled
up! I can&#8217;t go to school! And me with
a new book, bought day before yesterday!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was I, little sister,&#8221; said Prudy, gently.
&#8220;It was an accident; I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;ve
hurt your apron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, it isn&#8217;t hurt any,&#8221; replied Dotty, in
a different tone; &#8220;not a speck, Prudy. But
won&#8217;t you please button my boots? There,
I wish I was a horse, and then my shoes
would be nailed on, and be done with it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>When the boots were buttoned, Dotty was
in another flutter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it time to start yet? What a slow
clock! Only eight! I&#8217;m going down to
help Norah hang out the clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the napkins and little things, Norah,&#8221;
said she, suddenly appearing in the
back-door yard with her apron half fastened.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have time before I go to school, and
mamma&#8217;s always willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose if you must, you must,&#8221;
said Norah, trying to talk with a clothespin
in her mouth; &#8220;but it&#8217;s pretty cold
weather for little girls like you to be out,
with nothing on their heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty took up a handkerchief, shook it
once or twice, and spread it on the line;
but before she had secured it with a clothespin,
it was frozen stiff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Norah, what makes you starch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the clothes before you put them out? Why
don&#8217;t you wait till they&#8217;re dry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t starch, Miss Dotty; it&#8217;s the cold
weather. You&#8217;d better run into the house
before you freeze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I haven&#8217;t hung out but one napkin
and two hangerjifs, Norah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter; your hands are as red as
lobsters; and, another thing, you&#8217;re shaking
the clothes all to pieces. Did I ever
tell you how your sister Prudy was served
once, when she was a wee thing, and wouldn&#8217;t
mind me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Prudy always mind? You said
she did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no; once Prudy was naughty. I
told her to go away from the door, and not
touch the frosty nails; but she didn&#8217;t pay
any heed; and by and by she came crying
to me, and do you believe, there were nails
sticking to her fingers.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Honest? truly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Prudy remembers it, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to go ask her,&#8221; said Dotty, dropping
a collar and bounding away. &#8220;Prudy,&#8221;
said she, rushing into the house breathless,
her cheeks and the tip of her nose glowing
with the kisses of the wind. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you
something. <em>Did</em> you ever have nails sticking
to your fingers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I have now,&#8221; replied Prudy,
holding out her hands, and exhibiting her
rosy finger-tips.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, those! Why, Prudy Parlin, I think
you&#8217;re real too-bad, and Norah too! She
didn&#8217;t want me to spread clo&#8217;es; so she told
a hint. She&#8217;s always telling hints. If I
was a Cath&#8217;lic, and little girls wanted to
hang out clo&#8217;es, and make thimble-cookies
and things, I wouldn&#8217;t treat &#8217;em so, and
say there was nails, when I meant fingernails!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, well, Dotty, Norah thinks we are try-patiences,
I s&#8217;pose. Mother doesn&#8217;t allow
her to scold, and so she has to <em>manage</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; ejaculated Dotty, with a curling
lip. But all this while the &#8220;slow clock&#8221;
was busy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it is a quarter <span class="smcap">OF</span>,&#8221; said Prudy.
She uttered the words as coolly as if they
were of very slight importance; but Dotty&#8217;s
little heart beat like a drum. How often
had she heard Prudy say, &#8220;It&#8217;s a quarter <em>of</em>,&#8221;
and seen her skip out of the house, kissing
her hand for good by! As the door closed
after her, Dotty had always felt as if it shut
herself out of something beautiful&mdash;something
every way desirable.</p>

<p>And now it was coming,&mdash;the day and
the hour. She was about to be a school-girl
at last. No longer a little child, who
stays at home and plays with paper dolls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
but a little woman, who goes out to learn
the ways of the world.</p>

<p>As the two children walked on together
in advance of Susy, every object looked to
Dotty wondrous fair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prudy,&#8221; said she, confidentially, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
played enough. I may play a little more
once in a while, but not much. I want to
grow a great lady, like mamma, and read
poetry, and write letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear; but when you get to talking
so fast, you keep pushing me into the street
with your elbow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I? I didn&#8217;t mean to. O, how white
the world is! Looks like a frosted cake.
Prudy, don&#8217;t you wish you&#8217;s dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; what an idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I don&#8217;t, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what made you ask if I did, Dotty
Dimple?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, I was only thinking about the angels
sifting down snow. Look at the drift top
o&#8217; that store. So hard you could jump on
it, and not leave a scar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Dotty, keep your elbow still.
Here we are at the school-house. Now
remember, you must behave like a little
lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Needn&#8217;t tell me that, Prudy Parlin. It
isn&#8217;t as if I was <em>some</em> girls, that don&#8217;t know
your A B C&#8217;s. Six years old&mdash;going on
seven. Can&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty was about to say, &#8220;Can tie a bow-knot,&#8221;
and would have added quite a list
of other accomplishments; but as she found
herself just then in a crowd of little girls,
she very prudently closed her lips, and entered
the school-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Parker, this is my little sister
Alice,&#8221; said Prudy, going up to the teacher;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
&#8220;but people know what you mean better
if you say &#8216;Dotty Dimple.&#8217; She has never
been to school before; but she can read in
the First Reader, if you let her spell the
hard words aloud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Miss Parker, with a
smile. &#8220;I welcome Prudy Parlin&#8217;s sister;
and if she is half as good as Prudy, I shall
never like to part with her to go up stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prudy slid her hand into Miss Parker&#8217;s.
She remembered how that warm-hearted
young lady had kissed her with tears when
she left the primary department.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I think she&#8217;ll be good, Miss Parker,&#8221;
said Prudy, in a low voice, while Dotty was
looking out of the window; &#8220;only she never
went to school in her life, and if she doesn&#8217;t
sit very still, I hope you&#8217;ll try to excuse her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Parker gave the little pleader a
hearty embrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Good by Dotty,&#8221; said Prudy. &#8220;I must
leave you now. Remember, when you go
out to read, you mustn&#8217;t twist your front
hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought of twisting it, or sneezing
either. Just&#8217;s if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Prudy was gone. Presently the bell
rang, and school had begun. Miss Parker
gave Dotty a seat beside a little girl in a
dark-blue frock, who had eyes the color of
gray stocking-yarn, and a dent in her chin
so deep that Dotty was rather mortified, for
it eclipsed both hers entirely.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, then, she isn&#8217;t pretty, if she does
have such a &#8217;normous dimple, for there&#8217;s a
wart on her thumb, and I don&#8217;t like warts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl&#8217;s name was Sarah Penny,
usually called Tate. She looked at the new
scholar with some curiosity. Their eyes
met, and then Tate smiled, showing some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
irregular little teeth. Dotty smiled too,
making her dimples as deep as possible.
She watched Tate&#8217;s chin, and was pleased
to observe that the dent never moved. After
this silent but friendly greeting, the
two children felt a little acquainted.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a real beauty,&#8221; thought the good-natured
Tate, gazing at her companion&#8217;s
lovely face without envy.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>She</em> has zigzag teeth,&#8221; thought the critical
Miss Dimple; &#8220;but I like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tate opened her Testament, and let Dotty
look on with her while Miss Parker read
aloud the morning chapter. It was a leather-covered
Testament, and had been scratched
by penknives.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose she&#8217;s a poor little girl,&#8221; thought
Dotty, &#8220;or she wouldn&#8217;t have such an <em>owdrageous</em>
old book! The outside of it&#8217;s all
wrinkled up&mdash;looks like a raisin.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>At this same moment Tate was thinking,
&#8220;I s&#8217;pose <span class="smcap">SHE&#8217;S</span> a rich little girl,&mdash;got on a
ring!&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither of the children, I fear, paid much
heed to the reading. Tate turned back to
the fly-leaf, and pointed out to Dotty the
words in blue ink, &#8220;The Property of Isaac
S. Penny,&#8221; followed by the wonderful couplet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="booklistbox boxcontainer">
<p>
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t believe this book is mine,<br />
<span style="padding-left:0.5em">Please look on page thirty-nine.&#8221;</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Dotty could not read the writing, but was
delighted with various hearts and darts,
drawn in red ink, and eagles in black, with
wings made of loops, and bills made of
points. She thought they must have been
drawn by a great genius.</p>

<p>After the morning exercises, she sat very
prim, and looked straight before her at the
blackboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t so much as wink,&#8221; thought she.
&#8220;I wish Prudy could see me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this unnatural stillness did not last
long. Dotty very soon found that her companion
had a slate, and she began to make
pictures on it, swaying herself to and fro
as she drew. Tate looked over Dotty&#8217;s
shoulders, and watched the pictures as they
grew. It puzzled her a little to guess what
they were meant for; and, strange to say,
the little artist was quite as much puzzled
herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this thing?&#8221; whispered she to
Tate. &#8220;I made it for a cat; but then, I went
and put feathers in the tail, and now I guess
it&#8217;s a turkey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tate wrinkled her forehead, and eyed the
doubtful picture with a wise look.</p>

<p>&#8220;It &#8217;pears to me,&#8221; replied she, hesitating,&mdash;&#8220;it
&#8217;pears to me more like a tea-pot.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, whispering was against the rule, and
Dotty knew it as well as Tate; but they
both thought if they put their heads together,
and spoke so low that no one else could
hear, there was no harm in it. At any rate,
so thought Tate, for she had done it so long
that her conscience was hardened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not whispering to <em>you</em>,&#8221; said she to
Dotty; &#8220;I&#8217;m whispering to the slate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty stared a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you spect me to hear,&#8221; said she; &#8220;so
it&#8217;s just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the time came for the youngest
class in the First Reader, Dotty felt a little
frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t read very well,&#8221; thought she,
&#8220;and p&#8217;raps the teacher&#8217;ll put me down to
the bottom of the foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>But her fears were groundless; she was
placed next to the head; and though the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
above her could read as fast as a stone rolls
down hill, Miss Parker said nothing about
sending Dotty Dimple to &#8220;the bottom of the
foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have as nice boots as they have, and
ruffles round my wrist,&#8221; thought the new
pupil; &#8220;but they are all littler than me,
and can read &#8217;thout spelling the words out
loud.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was very humiliating. Dotty&#8217;s curly
head sank a little. She stepped out of line,
and, closing her book, let it drop by her
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raise your book, Alice, my dear,&#8221; said
the teacher, kindly, &#8220;and keep your finger
on the place; that is the proper way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Dotty, demurely, and
opened her Reader wrong side upward, at
the same time stepping forward several
inches in advance of the other girls. Tate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Penny tittered a little, and Dotty drew back
in a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mamma never made me stand in a
straight line,&#8221; murmured she, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t
know how.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Parker saw Dotty&#8217;s mortification, and
hastened to soothe her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say you will learn so fast,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;that you will make all these other
little girls very much ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty looked up, and her eyes brightened.
&#8220;You never went to school before, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Dotty, briskly, her unusual
bashfulness disappearing in a moment.
&#8220;No&#8217;m, I never; only, when I was at grandpa
Parlin&#8217;s, I went some days with Jennie
Vance. My mamma used to let me read
in her lap. You see she <em>couldn&#8217;t</em> make me
stand up in a row, &#8217;cause I wasn&#8217;t but one
girl.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The other children smiled. They thought
this must be a very strange child, to talk so
familiarly with the teacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prudy taught me my letters,&#8221; she went
on: &#8220;A for ape, and B for bat&mdash;looked as
if he had an umberella on him&mdash;and C for
cat&mdash;a story for every one I learned. Prudy
told real pretty stories, too. I can remember
&#8217;em now. But my mamma didn&#8217;t have
much time to &#8217;tend to my reading; so she
said, after Christmas I must go to your
school.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Parker pressed her lips together firmly&mdash;a
habit she had when anything amused
her. It was very clear to her mind that Miss
Dimple did not understand the ways of a
school-room. Dotty saw the other little
girls looking at one another as if they
were amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;They like to hear me talk,&#8221; thought she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
throwing back her curly head. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk
some more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Parker, may I have a drink of
water? &#8217;Cause I&#8217;ve been eating snow; and
when I eat snow it makes me thirsty. Jennie
Vance used to carry a little bottle to
school; but her teacher said she mustn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lina Rosenberg, it is your turn to read,&#8221;
remarked Miss Parker. &#8220;We will have no
more talking, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new scholar dropped her head, &#8220;like
violets after rain,&#8221; thinking, &#8220;O, dear, dear!
what have I done now?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">DOTTY AND TATE.</span></h2>


<p>&#8220;Well, little sister,&#8221; said Prudy that
evening, &#8220;how do you like going to school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about it; you ask
too many questions,&#8221; replied the child, turning
away suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Dotty! I hope you haven&#8217;t been a
bad girl. Did Miss Parker have to speak to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She spoke to me&mdash;yes; what you s&#8217;pose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you and that little Penny girl whisper,
Dotty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She talked to the slate, but she
<em>meant</em> me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, Dotty! And you answered back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, Prudy! D&#8217;you think I&#8217;se going to
sit there and not say anything, and her a
talking to me the whole time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to act awfully, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221;
thought poor Prudy, who felt the whole care
of her little sister on her own young shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t twirl your hair, and talk in
the class, Dotty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty stooped to pick up a pin which was
not on the carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Prudy! I&#8217;m going to get me some
paper, and oil it, and put it over pictures,
and it&#8217;ll draw splendid! With butter, you
know! Shines through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prudy saw the flush of shame on her sister&#8217;s
cheeks, but did not know how keenly
she was suffering.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t tell Prudy how the girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
laughed at me, and thought I was a <em>nidiot</em>.
And the teacher too, I saw <em>her</em> laughing,
inside of her sleeves. Every time I think
of it I want to shut myself up in the closet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you like your school, Alice,&#8221;
said Mr. Parlin, as the family were all seated
in the parlor after tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty well, sir,&#8221; answered Dotty, faintly.
&#8220;There was a man came in and talked.
He said he learned <em>his</em> letters with a whalebone.
I mean his teacher snipped him
with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the same man,&#8221; said Prudy, &#8220;that
came up stairs and talked to us. I guess he
was a printer, for he told a story, and he
said, &#8216;The man approached the child, and
found her weeping.&#8217; If he hadn&#8217;t been a
printer he wouldn&#8217;t have said that; he&#8217;d have
said, &#8216;The man <em>went up</em> to the child and
found she was <em>crying</em>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by a printer, Prudy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, these men that write books, papa.
They always use all the big words&mdash;don&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty was much obliged to her kind sister
for leading the conversation away from the
primary school, for she had been afraid some
one might strike in with an awkward question.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear! I hoped I was going to have
the sore throat,&#8221; thought she, as she awoke
next morning; &#8220;and then I could stay away
from school. But nothing pleasant ever
happens to me. When I want the sore
throat, I can&#8217;t have it; and when I don&#8217;t
want it, that&#8217;s the very time it comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>For several days Dotty continued to feel
unhappy, and hardly dared play with the
other little girls, lest they should laugh at
her. But by degrees her sensitiveness wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
away, and after practising on her lessons at
home till she could read without stumbling
over the hard words, she became the gayest
of the gay.</p>

<p>She drew her sled to school nearly every
day, for there was enough dirty snow and
ice in the yard to afford a little coasting.
Several of the other children had sleds, but
Lina Rosenberg had none, and, remembering
the former friendship between herself and
Dotty, followed her like her shadow, begging
for rides.</p>

<p>Dotty bore this for a while; but at last her
patience gave way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lina Rosenbug,&#8221; said she with dignity,
&#8220;some days I can let you ride, and some
days it may not be convenient for me to do
so. I should <em>devise</em> you not to tease.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lina pouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother says you&#8217;re a big-feeling little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
girl,&#8221; cried she. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t stay to
my house; you ran home, and crawled into
the cellar; you know you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; retorted Dotty, &#8220;&#8217;cause my mamma
didn&#8217;t wish me to play with you, and I
knew it. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d rather stay down
cellar. She said you <em>betwitched</em> me, Lina
Rosenbug.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty was sorry, next minute, that she
had spoken so unkindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Lina never&#8217;ll speak to me again,&#8221;
thought she. &#8220;Would <em>I</em> play with a little girl
when her mamma said I <em>betwitched</em> her?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dotty was quite mistaken. Lina had
heard cross words all her little life, and was
hardened to them. She clung to Miss Dimple
only the more closely after this; which
was a pity, for Dotty was really anxious to
obey her mother, and keep away from the
beguiling little Jewess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Dotty was becoming rather intimate
with her young seat-mate. She knew
precisely how many dresses Tate had, and
how many she expected to have; the names
of her uncles and aunts; which were the
good ones, that gave presents, and which
were the cross ones, that made you shut the
doors after you, and said, &#8220;O, <em>she</em> can skip
up stairs and get my cap-box; she&#8217;s just big
enough to run.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her turn Dotty related all her own
adventures, both by sea and land, Tate listening
with a quick twinkle of her large gray
eyes, which was very encouraging.</p>

<p>Dotty did not spend all her time in whispering:
she sometimes tried to study; but
it was very hard to fix her thoughts. She
would repeat a word again and again, and
all the while be thinking of something else;
or she would mean to look at her book, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
instead of that, find herself watching Miss
Parker, or counting the buttons on some little
girl&#8217;s frock.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that Miss Parker, though
a fine teacher, and an excellent young lady,
had one very foolish method; and it was
this.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, before the school was
dismissed, she asked the children to tell her
if they had whispered during the day; and
if they declared they had not, she smiled,
and seemed very much pleased. All this
would have been well enough, if the little
creatures had told the truth; but, alas! they
were so anxious for their teacher&#8217;s smile, that
they often, very often, told falsehoods.</p>

<p>Miss Parker had no idea she was tempting
them to do wrong. She believed every word
they said. If she had been more observing,
she might have known that the children, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
looked so innocent, were really sad little
chatterboxes. Dotty Dimple was amazed
to see Tate&#8217;s hand go up every night in token
that she had not whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Tate,&#8221; said she one day, &#8220;you&#8217;re
just as bad as Jennie Vance! She lies, &#8216;one
to another,&#8217; and so do you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tate looked grieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Dotty Dimple! I don&#8217;t do any such
a thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But nights, when Miss Parker asks if
we&#8217;ve whispered, you hold up your hand,
Tate; and that&#8217;s the same as to say, <em>you
never</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t speak, Dotty Dimple. I
shut my lips right together; and how <span class="smcap">CAN</span>
you tell a lie when you don&#8217;t tell anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dotty, hesitating, &#8220;p&#8217;raps it
isn&#8217;t telling a lie, but it&#8217;s <em>doing</em> a lie. Miss
Parker thinks you don&#8217;t whisper, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
she praises you. She never praises me,
&#8217;cause I keep my hand right down to my
side. I&#8217;m a great deal better&#8217;n you are,
Tate; but <em>she</em> doesn&#8217;t know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear! I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; said Tate, picking
nervously at the wart on her thumb. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like to get scolded at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I either don&#8217;t,&#8221; responded Dotty.
&#8220;Of course not&mdash;and her looking so sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you hold up your hand?&#8221;
said Tate. &#8220;She thinks you&#8217;re real bad. I&#8217;d
hold it up, and she&#8217;ll like you a great deal
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to dreadfully, Tate. I&#8217;d rather
hold up my hand than eat a choclid cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty sighed as she spoke, and gazed sorrowfully
at the beautiful teacher, whose love
seemed so sweet and desirable.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Tate! I&#8217;ve thought of something.
S&#8217;pose now we try not to whisper.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Tate looked up in her companion&#8217;s face
to see if she was in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not whisper!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; just one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we couldn&#8217;t, Dotty; it&#8217;s just no
use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try if you will,&#8221; said Miss Dimple,
anxiously, &#8220;&#8217;cause Miss Parker is a darling,
and I want her to love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you may try, Dotty Dimple, but
<em>I</em> shan&#8217;t! I tried one day last summer, and
it made me so hungry I like to died!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty said no more, but fell into a thoughtful
mood.</p>

<p>O, how delightful it would be to have
dear Miss Parker put her hand on her head,
and say, with one of those beaming smiles,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my good little Dotty Dimple!&#8221;</p>

<p>How painful to hear her say, in a tone
of displeasure,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Dotty, if you were only as good as
Tate! Tate doesn&#8217;t whisper all day long.
Why don&#8217;t you try to be like her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah, Miss Parker&#8217;s lovely brown eyes
could not have been very far-sighted, and
her pretty little ears, with the coral jewels
in them, were not good for much, I am sure.
Dotty scowled fiercely at Tate that night, as
she saw her hand rising like a little <em>white lie</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t half so good as I am,&#8221; thought
Dotty; &#8220;but Miss Parker doesn&#8217;t know it.
To-morrow I&#8217;ll try not to whisper, and then
she&#8217;ll call me a dear little girl, and it&#8217;ll be
the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>So to-morrow Dotty set out in earnest to
be a good girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Norah,&#8221; said she, going into the kitchen
at half past eight, while Prudy was busy
reading,&mdash;&#8220;Norah, is there any alum in
the house?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Slippery alum, do you mean, Miss Dotty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I guess it isn&#8217;t slippery.
I want a little piece about <em>so</em> big,&#8221; said Dotty,
exhibiting the ball of her thumb.</p>

<p>Norah took down a box from the highest
shelf in the pantry, and, after searching
a while, produced a bit of alum, and gave
it to Dotty.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t see what you want of it,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you ever tell anybody, Norah?
It&#8217;s to pucker up my mouth, so I shan&#8217;t
whisper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norah sat down upon the wood-box to
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who put such a queer notion as that in
your head, Miss Dotty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, heard my mamma say she ate some
once, when she was a little girl, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
wrinkled her mouth all up, so she couldn&#8217;t
talk; but don&#8217;t you tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t tell; but if that is what you
want it for, I shan&#8217;t dare give you so much;
it might make you sick. Here&#8217;s a bit as
big as a pea; it&#8217;s all you ought to have, Miss
Dotty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl put the precious morsel in
her pocket, intending to eat it the last thing
before she entered the school-room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">DOING A LIE.</span></h2>


<p>The alum gave Dotty&#8217;s mouth a puckery
sensation; though, to her disappointment,
she felt as much like talking as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Tate,&#8221; said she, firmly, &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to be good all day, as hard as I can; and I
<em>devise</em> you not to try to make me speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was before school began, and shortly
afterwards Tate forgot the admonition, and
fell to whispering, just as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dotty, there&#8217;s a boy,&mdash;his name&#8217;s Daniel
Page,&mdash;and he goes to church right before
our pew. He acts awfully. Did you
ever see Dannie?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Dotty shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you truly?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty shook her head again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he lives on next to the same street
you do. Didn&#8217;t you <em>never</em> see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty shook her head with treble force.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I was going to tell you what he
did last Sunday. Do you want to hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Dimple&#8217;s head shook as if she had
the palsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to tell you, anyway, it
was so queer. The minister he prayed, and
Dannie he stood up, and turned round, and
looked at me. And what do you s&#8217;pose he
put into his mouth?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty was growing interested; thought
of pea-nuts, taffy, licorice; but made no
reply except to scowl as severely as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;His hankychiff! Yes, it was. It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
red pictures over it&mdash;a lion and a man; and
he stuffed it right in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty wanted to say, &#8220;Not the whole!&#8221;
but shut her teeth together.</p>

<p>Tate proceeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He poked and he poked, and he stretched
his mouth open, and it kept going in, and
bimeby &#8217;twas all in, and the hem too&mdash;the
whole hankychiff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty&#8217;s eyes were big with astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw it. His cheeks stuck out
both sides, and his eyes too. I thought he
was going to choke to death; and then I
laughed!&#8221;</p>

<p>The recollection was so amusing that Tate
hid behind her slate, and shook all over,
while Dotty tried so hard to keep sober,
that she tittered outright. Miss Parker
frowned. This was a bad beginning. Dotty
wished it was nine o&#8217;clock, and she could
start again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Dotty Dimple?&#8221;
said Tate. &#8220;You look as if you didn&#8217;t
feel pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty thought there was no peace for her,
and began to shake her head again in despair.
The more Tate talked, the more she
shook it; and while it was going like a tree
in the wind, and she was bending on her
friend a feebly furious scowl, Miss Parker
drew near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Dotty, I am astonished,&#8221; said she,
with marked displeasure; &#8220;what makes you
behave so strangely to-day? You keep jerking
your neck as if you meant to break it
off. The children are watching you, and
laughing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty tried to make an excuse, but could
not think of any, and her silence seemed to
Miss Parker like sullenness.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear, dear!&#8221; thought the unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
child, &#8220;she thinks I mean to be naughty; and
it&#8217;s just &#8217;cause I try so <em>dreadfully</em> to be good!
It&#8217;s no use! I may eat all the alum there is
in the milliners&#8217; shops, and it don&#8217;t do anything
to my tongue. If it did, it&#8217;s no use.
Miss Parker never scolded when I whispered,
and now when I don&#8217;t whisper, she
does!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a very unpleasant reflection; it
confused the child&#8217;s ideas of right and wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;cause I want to please Miss Parker,
that I said I wouldn&#8217;t whisper; but it doesn&#8217;t
please her&mdash;it displeases her. She&#8217;ll never
love me &#8217;thout she&#8217;s a mind to, and I don&#8217;t
mean to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, when the teacher had passed down the
aisle, and was hearing the primer class, Dotty
turned round to Tate, and said, with a reckless
smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk away, Tate. I give it up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d give it up,&#8221; replied Tate,
triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I needn&#8217;t if I didn&#8217;t choose. I needn&#8217;t
speak forever &#8217;n&#8217; ever, and you couldn&#8217;t get
the blade of a knife in &#8217;tween my teeth. But
I shan&#8217;t; what&#8217;s the use, and her looking the
other way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I <em>always</em> told you,&#8221; said
Tate; &#8220;but you scolded, and said I was a
naughty girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so you are; and I&#8217;ll say it again,
&#8217;cause it&#8217;s the truth. You, a-holding up your
hand, and Miss Parker a-thinking you the
best kind of a girl, Tate Penny! But I&#8217;m
going to be naughty, too. She praises the
naughty ones. O, yes; <em>don&#8217;t</em> she praise &#8217;em?
and <em>we good ones</em>&mdash;O, it makes me feel
cross!&#8221;</p>

<p>After Dotty had said this, it seemed to
her she had excused herself to her own conscience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and could go on whispering as much
as she pleased. She and Tate had never
whispered so much before. They watched
every opportunity, when Miss Parker was
busy, to keep their little tongues moving.
Never did a pair of sociable pigeons, building
a nest in the spring, chat more eagerly
than these two children, with their heads
close together, and their fingers intertwined.
Every time Miss Parker happened to look
that way, they were studying very hard; and
she smiled, as if to say, &#8220;Good little girls!
Dear little girls!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very queer,&#8221; thought Dotty; &#8220;she <em>says</em>
it&#8217;s against rules to whisper, but we can do
it &#8217;thout her scolding the leastest bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Tate, &#8220;if I couldn&#8217;t see any
better&#8217;n Miss Parker can, I&#8217;d wear spettycles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she sees us when we do things she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
never told us not to, and not breaking rules
at all,&#8221; said Dotty, scornfully. &#8220;For <em>ninstance</em>,
she saw me shaking my head. Now,
why couldn&#8217;t I shake my head? <em>That</em> isn&#8217;t
against the rule!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but she came straight up here, and
said she was <em>&#8217;stonished</em>. What made her
&#8217;stonished, when I wasn&#8217;t breaking a rule?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was afraid you&#8217;d break your neck,&#8221;
said Tate.</p>

<p>The day wore on, and Dotty grew more
and more reckless.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a great mind to hold up my hand
to-night,&#8221; thought she; but could not quite
decide to do it. She was so busy debating
the question that she hardly noticed when
her spelling-class was called, and walked out
behind Tate like one in a dream.</p>

<p>After the spelling, there came, as usual,
the awful question,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;How many have whispered to-day? All
those who have not whispered may hold up
their hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty saw Tate&#8217;s hand go up fearlessly, as
it always did. Why not hers too?</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m some bad, I might as well be all
bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty gave one glance at Miss Parker&#8217;s
red ear-rings, one glance of shame at her
own boots, and then began to raise her left
arm slowly, slowly, for <em>something</em> seemed to
hold it down. It felt as heavy as an iron
weight. She almost needed the other hand
to help her draw it up. At the same time
<em>something</em> knocked loudly at her heart,
&#8220;Stop! stop! stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the arm got up at last, and nobody
saw that it was as stiff as marble; it looked
like the other arms that were raised, only it
was in a sleeve that had a crimped ruffle
round the wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Parker saw Dotty&#8217;s hand, and her
beautiful mouth was wreathed with smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; cried she, &#8220;that is just what I&#8217;ve
been wanting to see! I have looked in vain
for that little hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty gazed at a crack in the floor; for
she could not meet her teacher&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; added Miss Parker,
stroking Dotty&#8217;s hair, &#8220;don&#8217;t you feel a
great deal happier to-night than usual? a
great deal lighter-hearted? You don&#8217;t know
how this makes me love you, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>There it was; the praise of her teacher!
Just what she had been longing for so much.
But why didn&#8217;t it make her happy? Happy!
She was one mass of misery from head to
foot. When Miss Parker kissed her so tenderly
for good by, she wanted to scream, for
the kiss &#8220;burnt her mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; cried Tate, as they left the
school-room, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you glad you did it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; said Dotty, turning round
upon her friend in a sort of frenzy, and
shooting out the words like pins and needles.
&#8220;What you s&#8217;pose? I should think you&#8217;d
be &#8217;shamed, Tate Penny; so &#8217;shamed you&#8217;d
want to die! Telling me to hold my hand
up, when it&#8217;s a <em>bommernibble</em> big black lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t to&#8217;ve done it,&#8221; returned
Tate, cowering before the lightning in Dotty&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the wickedest girl there is in this
town,&#8221; went on the angry child. &#8220;Made me
whisper, when I ate alum to purpose not to!
Keep a-talking so I had to shake my head
and make the scholars see it, and get scolded
at! And then you <em>devised</em> me to tell a lie!
I feel it coming up into my throat, Tate
Penny; it chokes me so I can&#8217;t talk. It&#8217;s
worse&#8217;n if I&#8217;d said it. When you <em>do</em> a lie,
it&#8217;s a great deal worse.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Tate was too much overwhelmed to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I know one thing,&#8221; cried Dotty, setting
her heels down firmly; &#8220;God won&#8217;t
blame me. He&#8217;ll blame <span class="smcap">YOU</span>. You go right
home, and think how you&#8217;ve been acting,
Tate Penny! And to-night, when you go to
bed, you pray just as hard as you can!&#8221;</p>

<p>These words came out in a sudden gust.
&#8220;Just as hard as you can, Tate Penny, for
you&#8217;re the one&#8217;s been wicked; not me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, without a word of farewell, the children
parted, Tate turning to the left with a
puzzled look, as if she really did not know
whether she was wicked or not, and Dotty
turning to the right, her heart and throat
full of choking sobs without any tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">DOTTY AND HER MOTHER.</span></h2>


<p>In spite of all Dotty had said about her
own innocence, she felt so guilty that she
was ready to sentence herself to the &#8220;penitential.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, little one, how have things gone
to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>So said her father; for at the table she
sat gazing mournfully at a piece of sponge
cake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, papa. May I have a new
slate? &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve broke mine across the
middle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin, as well as her husband, noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Dotty&#8217;s sorrowful face; but she made
no remark till she went up stairs to put the
child to bed. Then she took her into her own
chamber, and seating herself in a sewing-chair,
before the fire, drew Dotty into her
lap. Nothing was said; but the little girl
understood the action very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, I did do wrong. How&#8217;d you
know it, mamma?&#8221;</p>

<p>After this she hid her face, and the two
sat in silence for several moments, Mrs.
Parlin holding Dotty&#8217;s hand, and gently
stroking it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma, &#8217;twas Tate Penny made me do
it. Won&#8217;t you please to not let me sit with
Tate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she make you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Made me tell a &#8217;normous story, big as a
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t mean a lie?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m; I didn&#8217;t <em>say</em> a lie, but <em>did</em> a lie;
did it with my hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Dotty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I held it up, mamma, same&#8217;s to say, I
never; but I did, and the alum hadn&#8217;t kept
me from it; not a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl was quivering all over with
agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;By and by, when you can talk better, you
may tell me what you did with your hand,
and what you mean by the alum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear, mamma! I&#8217;m all choked up,
and can&#8217;t talk; but &#8217;tisn&#8217;t my alum, &#8217;cause
that didn&#8217;t do a thing to my tongue. Norah
gave me some as big as the end of a slate pencil;
but it never did a thing to my tongue.
I could talk as fast as I could speak. But I
wouldn&#8217;t, and I didn&#8217;t; and then Tate made me
most shake my neck off; till bimeby I didn&#8217;t
care, and the teacher didn&#8217;t care either. It&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
against the rule; but there she sits in the
desk,&mdash;Miss Parker does,&mdash;and don&#8217;t hear
anything, only when she&#8217;s hearing classes
and things; and then never looks anywhere,
only right at the Reader, and picks a place
in her neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk <em>quite</em> so fast, dear, and then I
shall understand you better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said, mamma, she don&#8217;t see us break
the rules, &#8217;thout she&#8217;s walking up the aisle,
or sometimes when she looks up quick out
of a book. She says it&#8217;s against the rules
to whisper; but we do, and she likes us just
the same; only if we don&#8217;t put up our hand
she don&#8217;t like us, and don&#8217;t praise us. I
don&#8217;t want her a-praising <em>me</em>, not when I&#8217;ve
been naughty&mdash;should you, mamma? But
Tate does. Tate held up <em>her</em> hand, and
I didn&#8217;t mean to; but the first thing I
knew, I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Dotty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I shouldn&#8217;t, not if Tate hadn&#8217;t!
&#8217;Twas wicked; &#8217;twas lying one to another,
mamma; but Tate has done it five hundred
million times! She&#8217;s a worse girl&#8217;n I am.
O, dear me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot stop now to talk of Tate Penny,&#8221;
said Mrs. Parlin; &#8220;we must attend
first to Dotty Dimple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m. I knew you&#8217;d &#8217;tend to me. I
don&#8217;t b&#8217;lieve Tate&#8217;s mother &#8217;tends to <em>her</em>.
I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pect Tate knows much about the
Bible, p&#8217;raps. Isn&#8217;t it awful?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty picked away at the tidy on the back
of the chair with an air of unconcern; but
Mrs. Parlin observed that her mouth was
twitching at the corners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dotty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem very anxious to set Tate Penny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
right. She has told a wrong story: what
ought she to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty hung her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she should say to her teacher, &#8216;Miss
Parker, I&#8217;ve deceived you; I&#8217;m sorry,&#8217; would
that be enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mamma; and she wouldn&#8217;t say so&mdash;Tate
wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why wouldn&#8217;t it be enough, Dotty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, &#8217;cause, mamma, it isn&#8217;t Miss Parker
she&#8217;s &#8217;bused.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, &#8217;twas somebody else&mdash;&#8217;twas&mdash;God.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Dotty&#8217;s head was on her
mother&#8217;s bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think Tate has offended her
heavenly Father?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, &#8217;cause He put it in the Bible that she
mustn&#8217;t tell a lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And He went and put it in another place,
too,&#8221; added Dotty, laying her hand on her
left side; &#8220;right in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He put a whisper right into her heart,
mamma. She can&#8217;t hear it, but she can feel
it, just like a watch ticking; and it says,
&#8216;Please, Tate, <em>don&#8217;t</em> you tell a lie!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Dotty. I am glad to see that
you understand it so clearly. And now that
Tate has disobeyed this whisper, what must
she do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the rest, mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;But tell, me, dear, as if I did not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask God to forgive her,&#8221; replied Dotty,
with her lips close to her mother&#8217;s sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what must Dotty Dimple do?
Hasn&#8217;t she, too, been a naughty girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>The child slid out of Mrs. Parlin&#8217;s lap,
and knelt before her on the rug.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, mamma,&#8221; said she, in a choked voice,
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid He won&#8217;t forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sorry you did wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, I am. And &#8217;twasn&#8217;t Tate Penny
made me; &#8217;twas <em>me</em> did it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is right, Dotty; so it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I won&#8217;t hold up my hand again,
&#8217;thout it&#8217;s to put my hair behind my ears. I
won&#8217;t do it to purpose&mdash;no, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Dotty, you need not be afraid.
&#8216;If we confess our sins, God is faithful and
just to forgive us.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certain true, will He, mamma?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear; we may always be sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty sighed heavily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you see, mamma, I knew I was doing
a lie, and I did it to purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a great sin, my child; mother
wouldn&#8217;t say it wasn&#8217;t. But if you are
sorry, and tell God so, He is so &#8216;faithful
and just,&#8217; that He will certainly forgive you.
He says He will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty paused a moment, while a look of
relief passed over her troubled face, then
whispered, brokenly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, our Father, please will you forgive
me? &#8217;Twas me did it&mdash;not Tate; and I
did it to purpose; but I&#8217;m <em>so</em> sorry, and don&#8217;t
ever mean to do it again. For Christ&#8217;s sake,
Amen!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">&#8220;THE SCREW-UP PENCIL.&#8221;</span></h2>


<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Dotty, next morning, with
eyes on the carpet, &#8220;I want to tell you something.
Mayn&#8217;t Prudy do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk to Miss Parker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better for you to make
your own confession, my daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty twisted her front hair very rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mamma, I could talk to her, you
know, if &#8217;twas about Tate Penny, how bad
she is; but this is about <em>me</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin reflected a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be better for you to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to Miss Parker yourself, and tell her you
are sorry you have deceived her; still, if
you are not brave enough to do it, and your
sister is willing, I shall make no objection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prudy said she was willing. Prudy was
always expected to stand with a little flask
in her hand, ready to pour oil on Dotty&#8217;s
troubled waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Parker,&#8221; whispered she, taking the
teacher aside, &#8220;my little sister has done a
dreadful thing, and she can&#8217;t be happy till
you forgive her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what has she done?&#8221; asked Miss
Parker. &#8220;She learns wonderfully fast. I
am pleased with Dotty. She gives me more
trouble than my little Prudy did; but I like
her very much. What has she done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She told you a wrong story last night,
Miss Parker. She and Tate Penny whisper
the whole time; but Dotty held up her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in the class, and you praised her for being
good; but she says your kiss &#8217;burnt her
mouth,&#8217; and the moment she got out of the
school-room it seemed as if her heart would
break.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember I praised her,&#8221; said Miss
Parker, thoughtfully. &#8220;I never dreamed she
had deceived me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you forgive her, Miss Parker? She
wants to know if you certainly do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, yes; you may tell her I forgive her,&#8221;
replied the teacher, still looking thoughtful.
&#8220;But do you say she and Tate Penny both
whisper? Tate has a very honest face; and
I have never seen her whisper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prudy did not wonder at this; she remembered
what a way Miss Parker had of <em>not</em>
seeing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <em>believe</em> Tate whispers,&#8221; said Prudy;
&#8220;but I ought not to have told of it. I&#8217;m
sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you did,&#8221; returned Miss Parker.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you did. It is just possible there
may be other little girls who act the lie. I
thought I could read faces, but the best of
us are liable to mistakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prudy hurried away, lest she should forget
herself so far as to smile. After she had
gone, Miss Parker called Dotty to her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sister has been telling me all about
it,&#8221; putting her arm around the child. &#8220;I
forgive you freely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty raised her face joyfully to meet her
teacher&#8217;s kiss, and this time it did not feel
like a coal of fire on her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you never will do so again, Dotty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll try, like a good little girl, not
to whisper?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty put a corner of her apron in her
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to love you, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And can&#8217;t you try not to whisper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dare to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dare?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m; I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;d break it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I only asked you to <em>try</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m; I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t hurt you to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only it gets me cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cross, Dotty? What an idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Makes my neck ache, and face ache.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Parker was amused. She did not
know what the child meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, I tried yesterday, and you didn&#8217;t
like it&mdash;two hours&mdash;&#8217;most three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m; you said you&#8217;s <em>&#8217;stonished</em>. I
shook my head, and shook my head, and
you told me to stop.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure I did. But what had that to
do with trying not to whisper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, &#8217;cause I kept saying, &#8216;No, no, no,&#8217; to
Tate, and wouldn&#8217;t answer her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she whisper to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty wanted to say, &#8220;Yes&#8217;m, awfully,&#8221;
but checked herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not say. My mamma doesn&#8217;t
wish me to tell things, Miss Parker. When
it&#8217;s sober true that people do things, she
won&#8217;t let me tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Parker pressed Dotty a little closer
to her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, my dear. But it seems that,
at any rate, you talk to Tate, and it makes
your neck and face ache if you don&#8217;t talk;
so perhaps I ought to separate you. What
do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m; no&#8217;m; I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I think <em>I</em> know, Dotty. I shall let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
you sit with Lina Rosenberg. She is a very
quiet child, and if you shut your lips together
very tight, I think you may keep
from whispering.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty longed to say that her mother
would not approve, for Lina was a naughty
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would that be telling a tale?&#8221; thought
she. And just as she had decided that it
would not be &#8220;a tale,&#8221; and it was her duty to
tell it, and just as she had opened her lips
to inform Miss Parker that the little Jewess
had <em>betwitched</em> her, Miss Parker rang the
bell, and there was not a moment&#8217;s time for
another word.</p>

<p>The exchange was made. Dice Prosser
(her true name was Lodoiska&mdash;too long for
every day) was taken away from Lina, and
placed with Tate, and Dotty and Lina were
to sit together. It was not a pleasant arrangement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Tate forgot that Dotty had
called her the &#8220;wickedest girl in the world,&#8221;
and as the child went away, books and all,
she bade her farewell with her eyes.</p>

<p>As for Dice, she was one of the dull ones,
whom nobody either likes or dislikes. She
had a half-awake look, as if she had been
taken out of bed and sent to school in the
middle of a nap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather sit alone if I was Tate,&#8221;
thought Dotty; &#8220;it would make me real
<em>lonesome</em> to sit with Dice Prosser.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lina gave Miss Dimple a sweet smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now,&#8221; whispered she, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
I&#8217;ve got somebody to talk to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you musn&#8217;t talk much, Lina Rosenbug,
and I shan&#8217;t never answer &#8217;thout I&#8217;m a
mind to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m going to be rather good;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
not <em>dreadful</em> good, but <em>rather</em> good. I&#8217;ve
whispered too much, and now I&#8217;m going to
take my screw-up pencil, and make pictures,
most o&#8217; the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good by, Dotty Dimple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by good by?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sh! I mean, don&#8217;t talk any more now,
&#8217;cause Miss Parker&#8217;s getting ready to walk
up the aisle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lina began to study with all her might.
Her teacher regarded her as a very good
girl, because she did her mischief slyly. Lina
was greatly interested in Dotty&#8217;s &#8220;screw-up
pencil,&#8221; which had been a Christmas present,
and in the afternoon tried to make Dotty
use hers in exchange&mdash;a short wooden
one; whose lead kept breaking off.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do I want of such a thing, Lina
Rosenbug? It won&#8217;t mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, just squeeze it in your fingers, close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
down to the tip, and that will hold in the
broken pieces,&#8221; said Lina, coolly. &#8220;You
ought to let me use yours a while, &#8217;cause you
never lent me your sled all day yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor shan&#8217;t all day to-morrow! Lina
Rosenbug, you take <em>French leave</em> with my
things, and you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little Jewess humbled herself at
once, and gave back the &#8220;screw-up pencil,&#8221;
which Dotty hastily dropped in her pocket,
for her class was called. She thought no
more about it that afternoon, being busy
with her slate; and then Lina was so funny!
She had a bottle in the desk with
&#8220;bitters&#8221; in it, which she said her mother
called &#8220;pancake drops;&#8221; very good for dropsy,
if taken every five minutes, &#8220;regular.&#8221;
So, while they were busy drawing pictures,
Lina would suddenly drop her slate and her
head, and behind the covers of the desk she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and her patient, Miss Dimple, would take
the medicine &#8220;regular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Best thing in the world to break up
fevers,&#8221; said Lina, gravely, as she passed
the &#8220;pancake drops&#8221; to Dotty&mdash;sugar and
water, with essence of peppermint thrown
in. &#8220;My oldest son had the <em>log-jaw</em>, and it
cured him so he died; and then my youngest,
she had the whirlymajig&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Lina Rosenbug, you stop! Seems&#8217;s if
I should scream right out,&#8221; gurgled Dotty;
and as she spoke, a &#8220;pancake drop&#8221; went
the wrong way, and choked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Less noise in the third seat,&#8221; said Miss
Parker; whereupon Dotty giggled outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is growing troublesome,&#8221; thought
Miss Parker; &#8220;putting mischief into Lina&#8217;s
head, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you&#8217;ve been a good girl
to-day, Dotty?&#8221; asked Miss Parker, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
spelling class. But she did not say a word
to any one about the whispering, and it was
a great relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Dotty, with a discouraged
sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you mean well,&#8221; added Miss
Parker, kindly; &#8220;but you must not tempt
Lina to do wrong. You are quite too full
of mischief, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so full as Lina Rosenbug,&#8221; was on
Dotty&#8217;s lips, but she did not let it come
out.</p>

<p>It was at this very moment that she
missed her pencil. Feeling a little nervous,
she had unconsciously put her hand
in her pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, where was her screw-up pencil?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty explored the depths of her pocket;
there was no pencil there, and no hole
either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I put it in, and I never took it out; and
where <em>did</em> it go to?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty&#8217;s mind went into a fog, but suddenly
came out as bright as a sunbeam.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why Lina wanted to keep me
drinking, so I shouldn&#8217;t remember; and that
was when she put her hand in and took it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty could hardly wait for school to be
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lina,&#8221; she cried, the moment they were
out of doors, &#8220;I know what you meant when
you kept me drinking your bitters, and now
I&#8217;ve found you out! Who&#8217;d you s&#8217;pose stole
my screw-up pencil? <em>You</em> did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? Me? O, what a story!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <em>you</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s in your pocket, Dotty Dimple.
I haven&#8217;t seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty went on without pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a present to me, you horrid Lina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Rosen<span class="smcap">bug</span>! Will you give it to me, now,
this minute? This minute, Lina Rosen<em>bug</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I give it to you, Dotty, when
I haven&#8217;t got it myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, but you have! I almost felt you
when you did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lina clasped her hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never, and I never, and I&#8217;ll keep saying
it forever,&#8221; cried she, looking very pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Lina Rosenbug, I knew, in the first
place, I oughtn&#8217;t to sit with you, when you
haven&#8217;t any mother to read the Bible to you&mdash;I
mean she never does; but it&#8217;s wicked
and against the rule to steal. I tell you so
if you never heard of it before, and you&#8217;re
an awful girl! I always knew it, ever since
I went to your house and staid all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Dotty&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, you needn&#8217;t say Dotty to me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;But I never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you did, for I <em>know</em>! And I&#8217;ll tell
my father the minute I see him! He won&#8217;t
&#8217;low little girls to steal the screw-up pencils
that people give me on the Christmas tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, do hear me, Dotty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I hear; only you tell what isn&#8217;t
true, and the more you don&#8217;t talk, the better
you&#8217;ll feel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear! O, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you feel sorry, then, Miss Rosenbug?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t, Miss Dimple!
Why should I be sorry, when I never did
a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time, Lina&#8217;s face, which had been
very pale, was flushing crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, you naughty, horrid girl!&#8221; cried
Dotty, so loud that some of the other children
could not help hearing. &#8220;You dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
girl! When they take you and put you
in the lock-up, and swear you to the jury,
and the mayor says, &#8216;It wasn&#8217;t your screw-up
pencil; little girl, what did you take it
for?&#8217; <em>then</em> what&#8217;ll you do, Lina Rosenbug?
O, then I guess you&#8217;ll be sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Dotty Dimple, do hush! Don&#8217;t
you see the girls are hearing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they ought to hear, for it&#8217;s the
sober, honest truth, as ever was in all this
world, Lina Rosenbug!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">DOTTY AND LINA.</span></h2>


<p>When Dotty reached home her eyes were
blazing. A few tears would have quenched
their fire, but she had not the &#8220;gift of
tears.&#8221; She ran all over the house to find
her mother, and tell the story of the screw-up
pencil; but Mrs. Parlin had gone out,
and did not return till tea was ready. By
that time Dotty was calmer, and her father
only observed that her cheeks were unusually
red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, chickie, how have things gone
with you to-day? You have not had very
good lessons, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Dotty, in an excited
tone. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t miss but one word, and that
was the teacher&#8217;s fault; she put out &#8216;saw,&#8217;
but didn&#8217;t say whether it was &#8216;I saw John,&#8217;
or a thing to chop wood with; so <em>of course</em>,
I spelled it s-e-w!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Parker should be more careful how
she puts out words. Is it not surprising
how everybody contrives to cheat my little
daughter, while she herself so seldom makes
mistakes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty did not see that her papa was joking,
and feeling very much pleased with his
remarks, she was about to pour out the story
of her trials, when Prudy said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Saw? saw?&#8217; Is that a preposition,
papa, or an adverb?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin laughed again, and remarked
to his wife that he thought their children
were &#8220;growing very learned.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Prudy,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are attending the
grammar school. Do you study grammar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, and like it ever so much,&#8221;
replied Prudy, brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what a verb is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, yes, sir; it&#8217;s a word that signifies to
be, to act, or to be acted upon,&#8221; was the
parrot-like reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Now can you tell me what
is the verb in this sentence: &#8216;John struck
James with a big stick.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, yes, papa&mdash;<em>big stick</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! Why so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, sir, because the stick was what he
did it with. P&#8217;raps he wouldn&#8217;t have dared
strike him at all if he hadn&#8217;t had any stick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, what an idea!&#8221; cried wise Susy.</p>

<p>But her father and mother were not at
all disturbed by Prudy&#8217;s ignorance, and did
not even try to set her right. In fact, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
thought she was too young to study grammar.</p>

<p>&#8220;But all this while we have not heard
from Dotty,&#8221; said Mrs. Parlin; &#8220;she began
to speak a little while ago, and some of us
interrupted her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, nothing, mamma, only Lina Rosenbug&#8217;s
been stealing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stealing, Dotty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m; my screw-up pencil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you perfectly sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mamma; my pocket was next to
her, and there&#8217;s where I put my pencil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said Mr. Parlin. &#8220;Your
pocket&#8217;s being next to a person doesn&#8217;t prove
that that person has put his hand in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if she didn&#8217;t, papa, who did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, my daughter; perhaps nobody.
How would you like it if Lina should
say she knew you stole her mittens, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
because they happened to be hanging on a
nail beside your cloak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, papa, I shouldn&#8217;t want to steal her
mittens; they&#8217;re all full of holes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin said nothing more just then.
It was so hard to reason with the little
girl, that one was obliged to choose one&#8217;s
words with care.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the very first place, Dotty,&#8221; said her
mother, &#8220;do you know you have lost the
pencil? Perhaps it is laid away in a book,
or in your desk, or there may be a hole in
your pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mamma; it isn&#8217;t anywhere at all, for
I&#8217;ve looked in all those places, and there&#8217;s
no hole in my pocket, either. Lina was
the one that took it, &#8217;cause she liked that
pencil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful, Dotty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I&#8217;m very careful. I just know she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
did it; and Mrs. Rosenbug wouldn&#8217;t mind
if she did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dotty, I cannot allow you to talk so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I won&#8217;t; but I went there
once, and staid all night, mamma, and that&#8217;s
how I know about Mrs. Rosenbug and the
dog. But I couldn&#8217;t make her say she did
it; she kept saying she never. I devised
her to give it right back. I told her I&#8217;d tell
my papa, and when the mayor took her to
the jurymens, <em>then</em> how&#8217;d she feel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Dotty, did you talk so to Lina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I didn&#8217;t say much, mamma; only told
her she was an awful, wicked, horrid girl;
and oughtn&#8217;t I to say so, you know? for it&#8217;s
the black and blue truth, mamma, and you
wouldn&#8217;t want me to tell a lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty&#8217;s tongue was running at such a rate
that it must be stopped at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go up stairs, Dotty, and get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
your grandmother&#8217;s knitting; but do not let
us hear another word about your pencil to-night.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Screw-Up Pencil.</span>&mdash;<a href="#Page_81">Page 81</a>.</div>
</div>

<p>After Dotty had gone to bed and forgotten
her great wrong in a refreshing sleep, Mrs.
Parlin went into the child&#8217;s room, and took
from the closet her little red frock. She
touched it with loving hands; for there is
something in the look of a little one&#8217;s clothes
that goes straight to a mother&#8217;s heart. She
wished to make sure there was no hole in
the pocket. She turned it wrong side outward,
and smiled as the slate pencils, empty
spools, buttons, strings, bits of licorice, and
wads of paper, fell into her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is everything here <em>but</em> the screw-up
pencil,&#8221; said she to herself; &#8220;and I see
no place where that could have crept out.
But what is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The skirt of the dress was lined, and just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
where the pocket went in was a rent an inch
long.</p>

<p>&#8220;She might have put the pencil in there;
let me see.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Mrs. Parlin examined, and found that
a long and slender substance had dropped
down to the bottom of the skirt. She put in
her finger, and drew out the screw-up pencil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little Lina! You have been unjustly
accused! It grieves me that my
daughter has such a hasty spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty was greatly surprised, in the morning,
to see the pencil lying on her pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;But perhaps it is not yours,&#8221; said her
mother; &#8220;it may belong to Tate Penny, or
some other little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, mamma Parlin, here&#8217;s a place where
I scratched it with a pin. What made you
think I didn&#8217;t know my own pencil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you said Lina had taken that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;But she didn&#8217;t, mamma,&#8221; said Dotty,
casting down her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, dear, but you said you &#8216;just
<em>knew</em>&#8217; she did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant&mdash;I&mdash;just <em>thought</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed! You only thought?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And just because you thought, although
you couldn&#8217;t know, you called Lina an &#8216;awful,
wicked, horrid girl.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I truly s&#8217;posed she was, mamma,&#8221; said
Dotty, with her finger in her mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your &#8216;truly s&#8217;poses&#8217; are very cruel
things, Dotty. What is going to be done
with that little fiery tongue of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty touched the tip of it, and felt very
much as if she would like to pull it out by
the roots.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you will ask Lina&#8217;s pardon for
accusing her falsely.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And after this I do hope my little girl
will beware of hasty judgments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty was very eager to atone for her
fault. The moment she saw Lina, she held
up the pencil, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t take it, Lina Rosenbug; now
I know you didn&#8217;t, for here it is; came out
of my dress&mdash;and I&#8217;m sorry I said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, I knew you&#8217;d find it,&#8221; said
Lina, highly delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be certain sure, next time, before
I tell a person they <em>did</em> steal,&#8221; added Dotty,
penitently. &#8220;Will you forgive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, yes, I forgive you,&#8221; replied Lina, with
a toss of her pretty head: &#8220;only you&#8217;d better
not say so again. What&#8217;d you think if I
should &#8217;cuse <em>you</em> of stealing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Dotty, quickly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
&#8220;You&#8217;d know better than to s&#8217;pose <em>I&#8217;d</em>
steal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Dotty Dimple! that&#8217;s the same as
to say <em>I</em> would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, no, Lina, I don&#8217;t think that. I
wouldn&#8217;t be so wicked! But I don&#8217;t like
to have you sit next to my pocket, though.
Won&#8217;t you please to change places?&#8221;</p>

<p>On the whole, it did not appear that Dotty&#8217;s
apologies had made a bad matter any
better. Still she thought she had done her
duty, and entered the school-room with a
serene face.</p>

<p>Lina walked behind her, looking very
sullen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">&#8220;BLOWING AWAY.&#8221;</span></h2>


<p>Things went on very much as usual with
Miss Dimple. Lina did not quite forgive
her for her unjust suspicions; still the two
little girls chatted together, and seemed to
be friends, for Lina knew how to keep her
anger out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t like to sit with her, though,&#8221;
said Dotty to Tate. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s
very <em>respectiful</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she is, either,&#8221; responded
Tate, rolling those eyes of hers, which, Dotty
said, looked like little bits of balls of gray
stocking-yarn, with a black pin in the middle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she is, either, and I
know why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why she isn&#8217;t respectiful?&#8221; said Dotty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; you tell me why <em>you</em> think so, and
then I&#8217;ll tell you why <em>I</em> think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8217;cause,&#8221; said Dotty, &#8220;her mother
sells <em>locker</em> beer, and snips with a thimble,
and keeps <em>such</em> a dog; and then they&mdash;O,
I don&#8217;t know what; but they don&#8217;t seem very
respectiful at that house. Now <em>you</em> tell
why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s so much dirt
on her dresses,&#8221; said Tate, lowering her
voice; &#8220;and that&#8217;s what I always thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any more dirt on her dresses
than there is on her aprons,&#8221; rejoined Dotty,
&#8220;and not quite so much; but any way, I
don&#8217;t want to sit with her, and she keeps me
whispering just as much as you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I don&#8217;t like to sit with that Dice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Prosser,&#8221; said Tate; &#8220;she&#8217;s just like a rubber
baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Tate: you and I are the best
kind of friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, Dotty Dimple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I said you&#8217;s the wickedest girl
there is in this state, I didn&#8217;t mean so,
Tate!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you didn&#8217;t mean so, for you
couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied good-natured Tate.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I like you ever so much,&#8221; said Dotty,
with emphasis, &#8220;only I don&#8217;t like you
about your holding up your hand, nights,
for that&#8217;s a lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t held it up for the longest
while, Dotty Dimple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; because Miss Parker has stopped
asking if we whisper. What you s&#8217;pose
made her stop? You&#8217;d do it just the same,
Tate, if she asked us; but then I forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
you; you are some bad, but not so bad as
Lina Rosenbug. It can&#8217;t hurt me if you do
tell stories with your hands, and I want to
sit with you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so do I want to sit with you, Dot
Dimple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Parker&#8217;s such a darling,&#8221; continued
Dotty, &#8220;and that&#8217;s what I began to say in
the first place: who knows but if we ask
her in just the prettiest way&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-day, but to-morrow,&#8221; said Tate;
&#8220;wait and I&#8217;ll wear my ruffled apron, and
we&#8217;ll go up to her together and tell her&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, no, Tate, we mustn&#8217;t tell her Lina
isn&#8217;t respectiful! P&#8217;r&#8217;aps she doesn&#8217;t know
it, and it would be telling a tale. We&#8217;ll take
hold of hands, and say, we want to be together,
&#8217;cause we&#8217;re the best friends that
ever was, and mean to be as good as ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Tate; and the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
parted at the foot of a blackened elm,
which they called &#8220;the half-way tree.&#8221; It
was the place where they usually parted at
night with a mutual kiss.</p>

<p>It happened that the next day was stormy,
so Tate could not wear her ruffled apron.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if we were going to have a
heavy snow-storm,&#8221; said Mrs. Parlin, looking
out of the window. &#8220;Edward, is it best to
let Alice go to school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, yes, I think so,&#8221; said Mr. Parlin, &#8220;you
are not very tender&mdash;are you, chickie?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty had two little front pockets in her
wrapper, and they were full of pop-corn.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, papa,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I&#8217;m ever so
tough,&#8221; and went on sprinkling salt into
her pockets from the salt-box with holes in
the top. &#8220;No, papa, I want to go to school
to-day very <em>partic&#8217;lar</em>. I wouldn&#8217;t stay at
home if the snow came down as big as this
pop-corn.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>So Dotty was put into a water-proof
cloak, and went with her two sisters; no
more afraid of the storm than a snow-bird
wrapped in his feathers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You here? O, ho!&#8221; said Tate, putting
her arm around Dotty; &#8220;they like to not let
me come; but I told &#8217;em you and I had some
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I told my mother,&#8221; said
Dotty; &#8220;now let&#8217;s go right up to Miss Parker,
and ask her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I <em>dassent</em>, Dotty Dimple, my heart
beats so; let&#8217;s wait till noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children waited, and meanwhile it
snowed as if the sky were falling. Down
fell the flakes, and the wind, whistling in
glee, played with them, blowing them hither
and yon. The air was so full of the white
mass that Dotty thought the whole world
looked as if it was shrouded in spotted lace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
And presently it was not like lace; it was
like sheets waving to and fro, and you could
barely catch the faintest glimpses of trees
and houses. It seemed as if the children in
the school-room were shut out from the rest
of the world; yet the door that shut them
out was made of the softest snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea of such a storm,&#8221; thought
Miss Parker; &#8220;how are all these children
to get home to dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>But very soon the principal of the grammar
school, up stairs, sent her a note, saying
it was thought best not to dismiss school at
noon, but have &#8220;a long session.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Parker was glad of this, for she
knew, if her little pupils went home, their
parents would not be likely to send them
back in the afternoon. She heard all the
morning lessons, and then gave a half hour&#8217;s
recess, telling the children they might walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
about the room and whisper; but they would
not wish, she said, to go out of doors in such
a storm.</p>

<p>There was a deal of buzzing and promenading.
Tate and Dotty marched around,
holding each other by the hand, and humming
&#8220;John Brown,&#8221; under breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s the time to go up to Miss Parker;
she&#8217;s only eating an apple,&#8221; said Dotty.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I dassent yet; let&#8217;s wait till just
before the bell rings,&#8221; replied easy Tate, who
never would do anything disagreeable till
the last minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Dotty, &#8220;let&#8217;s go to the
window and look out. Did you <em>ever</em>, Tate
Penny? Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose angels have
wings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose, when the little
boys-and-girls angels get to playing up there,
the small feathers pop out?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And neither don&#8217;t I; only <span class="smcap">P&#8217;R&#8217;APS</span> they
do, and p&#8217;r&#8217;aps that&#8217;s snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bible don&#8217;t say so,&#8221; said Tate, &#8220;and
besides, they wouldn&#8217;t play hard enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, but the angels have such tender
wings,&#8221; said Dotty, confidently. &#8220;Now, if
you had &#8217;em on <em>your</em> back, and I should hit
you just so&mdash;not hard a bit&mdash;how the
feathers would fly!&#8221;</p>

<p>To make her meaning clear, Dotty gave
Tate&#8217;s shoulder a gentle pat, which would
have done no harm if Tate had not been
resting on one foot; but as she was, and the
floor just in that spot was slippery, she fell
against a desk, and made her nose bleed. She
used first her own handkerchief, then Dotty&#8217;s,
till both were drenched, and Dotty had
a wild impulse to offer her the pockets of
her wrapper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear, I&#8217;m so sorry, Tate Penny!
Your nose is just like an inkstand; every
time anybody touches it, it tips over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t any matter,&#8221; whispered Tate,
&#8220;only I shall bleed the floor, and bleed my
dress. I want to go home, and haven&#8217;t any
apron on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, take my slate, Tate Penny, and
the sponge, too, while I ask Miss Parker
if I mayn&#8217;t go home with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tate has got the nose-bleed, Miss Parker,&#8221;
said Dotty, &#8220;both sides of her nose,
and I was the one that did it, but &#8217;twas <em>untennyshal</em>.
Mayn&#8217;t I take her home before
she bleeds the house all up? She&#8217;s got it
real hard, both sides, Miss Parker.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earnest look in Dotty&#8217;s eyes was not
to be resisted. Miss Parker forgot the
weather, and consented. She knew Tate
lived very near the school-house; but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
did not reflect that in this whizzing storm it
was almost unsafe for such young children
to walk even a short distance.</p>

<p>The little girls hurried on their cloaks and
hoods, and started out, Miss Parker going
into the entry with them, and giving Tate
her own handkerchief, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Use snow, my dear. I wouldn&#8217;t come
back to school, for you won&#8217;t feel like it.
Dotty, perhaps you&#8217;d better not go; it&#8217;s a
terrible storm, and Tate can do as well
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dotty insisted, and Miss Parker said
no more. If she had only opened the outside
door she would have seen at once what
an imprudent thing she was allowing the
children to do; but instead of opening the
door, she turned and entered the school-room.</p>

<p>Dotty and Tate passed out into the storm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
The wind shrieked at them like some wild
animal, and rushed upon them as if it were
seeking its prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, O, Tate Penny,&#8221; said Dotty catching
her breath, &#8220;it&#8217;s going to blow us to which
ways!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s snow enough, and more too; but
I can&#8217;t&mdash;catch it,&#8221; gasped Tate, &#8220;to stop
my&mdash;nose with&mdash;for the wind won&#8217;t let
me&mdash;keep still a&mdash;mi&mdash;mi&mdash;minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, why! here I am, blowed down,&#8221;
cried Dotty; and next moment Tate blew
down too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to school,&#8221; said she, with a
tremulous sigh.</p>

<p>But this was not to be thought of, for as
they turned around, they were choked by a
powerful gust.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill blow us <em>out</em>,&#8221; wailed Dotty, feeling
like a feeble candle breathed upon by a giant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Tate&#8217;s nose had ceased to bleed; but as
they were now outside the school-yard, they
decided to keep on, especially as they could
not help it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t walk,&#8221; observed Dotty, helplessly;
&#8220;we blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still it was a hard struggle, for the snow
was very deep indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What store is this?&#8221; said Tate, suddenly,
after they had waded along in moody
silence for quarter of an hour. &#8220;<em>What</em> store
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know the way to your own
mother&#8217;s house?&#8221; returned Dotty, falling
head first into a drift.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but where are we going to now?
There used to be, O, Dotty, there used to be
a house here, and now it&#8217;s a <em>store</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tate Penny, I never saw such a girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is; I mean it was; and now what&#8217;s
this?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a burnt place,&#8221; said Dotty;
&#8220;don&#8217;t you know anything, Tate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A burnt place? We don&#8217;t live near a
burnt place. I don&#8217;t know where we are
any more,&#8221; said Tate, sitting down and beginning
to cry.</p>

<p>Dotty looked around quite bewildered.
Neither did she know where they were. She
presumed they must be in Portland, for
they had not had time to be blown out of
the city. Yes, it was Portland; but what
street? The late fire had swept away all the
old &#8220;landmarks,&#8221; and where there had been
buildings were now only black ruins. Tate
and Dotty were not the first who had been
confused by these heaps of brick and mortar;
many older people had lost their way
that winter.</p>

<p>Dotty tried to peer through the moving
sheets of snow-flakes, but only grew more
and more confused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;This must be somewhere else,&#8221; concluded
she, &#8220;somewhere else&mdash;a great way off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May be it&#8217;s Cape &#8217;Liz&#8217;beth,&#8221; said Tate,
crying afresh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tate Penny, get up, or you&#8217;ll die; that&#8217;s
the way to freeze to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to die,&#8221; moaned Tate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stop it; stop dying this minute,&#8221;
screamed Dotty.</p>

<p>Tate rose drearily, but let the wind blow
her down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear, Tate Penny, I wish your nose
didn&#8217;t bleed so easy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it does; but when I&#8217;m dead it
won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tate, Tate, we can&#8217;t ever be buried in
the <em>stemmitry</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause, we shall blow into the Stiftic
Ocean.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Do you s&#8217;pose we&#8217;ll die?&#8221; said poor Tate,
her eyes dripping icicles.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <em>I</em> shan&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Dotty; &#8220;but you
said <em>you</em> should.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tate really did not know whether to keep
her word or not. She thought she did not
care.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you do die, you&#8217;ll be dreadful
&#8217;shamed of it,&#8221; went on Dotty; &#8220;and there
won&#8217;t anybody pity you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to go,&#8221; said Tate, wringing
her hands, &#8220;I&#8217;m willing to go, and keep
going; but I don&#8217;t know where to go to.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke they had reached a corner.
&#8220;Where to go to,&#8221; they might well ask, for
the wind started up afresh, and, instead of
blowing two ways, it blew four. It sent the
children towards the west, and in the next
instant hurled them north, against a lamp-post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think it need to act so to us
little girls,&#8221; said Tate, despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear,&#8221; cried Dotty. &#8220;O, <em>dear</em>, dear,
Tate Penny, I&#8217;m going to give up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tate shrieked aloud. If Dotty gave up
they were certainly lost.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">IS YOUR NAME SOLOMON?</span></h2>


<p>All this while, Mr. Parlin, doing business
in the city, and his wife, sewing by her
cheerful fire, had neither of them felt any
anxiety about their children. Why should
they? They supposed them safe at school.</p>

<p>At one o&#8217;clock, as the storm was still increasing,
Mr. Parlin went after them with a
horse and sleigh. Susy and Prudy muffled
themselves and danced down stairs in high
glee, for such a fearful storm as this was an
event in their lives. But where was Dotty?
Their father came out of the primary room
with a pale face, and Miss Parker followed
him, repeating,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure, Mr. Parlin, there is nothing
to fear. She only went to Mrs. Penny&#8217;s
with Sarah&mdash;not an eighth of a mile. You
turn down &mdash;&mdash; street, and it is the first
house you see on the right,&mdash;brown, with
green blinds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I understand, Miss Parker;
but I wonder you dared let such little ones
go out of the yard. I trust it is all right;
but if I were in your place, I would not
allow it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin told Susy and Prudy to wait
while he went to Mrs. Penny&#8217;s with the
sleigh. Of course, when he got there, the
Pennys knew nothing about the children,
and were in a great fright on being informed
that, more than an hour ago, Tate had started
for home with Dotty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penny was a widow; she had no one
to send in search of her missing child but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
her son Ben, a lad of fourteen, who was just
recovering from a slow fever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go, mother,&#8221; pleaded Ben; &#8220;I
can&#8217;t stand it to sit here and do nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother helped him draw on his overcoat,
and then, with trembling fingers, she
wound a shawl about his hectic cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go down by the Back Cove, and I&#8217;ll
drive to Munjoy,&#8221; said Mr. Parlin, hoarsely.</p>

<p>But first he had to go to the school-house
for Susy and Prudy. He would have let
them wait, but feared their mother would be
anxious. He hurried them home with scarcely
a word. They ran into the house very
merrily, just as he had meant they should
do; and when their mother cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my little snow-images, where&#8217;s Dotty?&#8221;
they said, gayly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, she&#8217;s gone to Tate Penny&#8217;s; father
went for her; it&#8217;s something about the
nose-bleed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin did not think twice of the
matter. She had as much as she could do
to shake the children&#8217;s clothes, and listen to
their lively prattle about the snow-storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there ever anything like it when
you were a little girl?&#8221; said one. &#8220;And
can there be a <em>flood</em> of snow? The rainbow
isn&#8217;t any sign, is it, only about the rain?&#8221;
said another.</p>

<p>&#8220;It appears to me,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Parlin,
looking at the clock, &#8220;your papa is gone a
long while. I thought Mrs. Penny lived
very near?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So she does,&#8221; answered Prudy. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid Tate is sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin feared so too, and that her
husband was needed to go for the doctor.
It must be dreadful, she thought, for people
to be sick in such a terrible storm. It had
not occurred to her, as yet, to be alarmed
about her child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The storm was all this time increasing, till
Mr. Parlin could see neither the road nor
his horse, and the poor animal scarcely knew
whether he was wading through clouds or
snow-drifts.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly is not strange the children
should lose their way,&#8221; thought Mr. Parlin.
&#8220;I must have a care, or I shall lose mine,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>As his horse was only a hinderance, he
took him back to the stable, and pursued
his way on foot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now we will return to the little ones, and
see what they were doing.</p>

<p>Dotty had said she was going to give up;
still she struggled on, and Tate followed,
crying out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we die you&#8217;ll say &#8217;twas me did it; but
who hit my nose?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, Tate, I don&#8217;t want to talk. I don&#8217;t
<em>want</em> to talk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who tried to go back to the school-house,
Dotty Dimple, but you wouldn&#8217;t?
And then we&#8217;d have been alive now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty did not listen. She was thinking
about the whooping-cough. Had she been
saved from it in her babyhood, and lived
six years, to meet with such a doom at last?</p>

<p>&#8220;My mamma said I had the whooping-cough
so my face was purple. She thought
I&#8217;d die in it; but I never. I lived over it,
and the purple went off, and I&#8217;ve been alive
ever since till to-day. O, my mamma didn&#8217;t
think this morning how I was going to die
before she&#8217;d see me again! She&#8217;d have
kissed me a million times for good by;
she&#8217;d have hugged me like everything!
And then, after she&#8217;d cried her eyes out,
she&#8217;d have said, &#8216;Dotty, take off your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
water proof, dear; I don&#8217;t want my little
girl to go to school and never come home
any more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father didn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s doing,
when he said I wasn&#8217;t tender! He thought
I&#8217;d cough to death when I was little; he
didn&#8217;t know this was a great deal worse&#8217;n
the whooping-cough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unhappy Dotty! Unhappy Tate! Two
forlorn little creatures, fighting against a
terrible fate!</p>

<p>&#8220;There don&#8217;t anybody care what &#8217;comes
of us,&#8221; said Dotty aloud, at last. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t anybody anywhere, Tate Penny, and
nothing in this world but just snow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear,&#8221; echoed Tate, hugging herself.
&#8220;I never was so cold but just once, and
then my mother rolled me in a shawl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never&#8217;ll see your mother again,&#8221;
said Dotty, in a hard tone, as if she took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
grim pleasure in it; &#8220;never again; nor your
house, nor your brother Ben, nor your little
sister Tid. O, no! Just &#8217;cause your nose
bleeds so easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You stop saying that, Dotty Dimple; it&#8217;s
bad enough&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Tate, what you s&#8217;pose I care about
your nose? Miss Parker was the most to
blame. Only think, little things like us, in
the <em>Primary&#8217;s</em> Department! And to send
us off to freeze!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll feel dreadfully to-morrow,&#8221; said
Tate; &#8220;don&#8217;t you believe they&#8217;ll put it in
the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see something black,&#8221; exclaimed Dotty,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Enoch Rosenberg approached,
his face almost hidden under a
cloth cap and red comforter.</p>

<p>Dotty sprang upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, Solly,&#8221; cried she, &#8220;Solly Rosenbug!
<em>Is</em> your name Solomon? I know your
<em>brother&#8217;s</em> is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; my name&#8217;s Enoch,&#8221; replied the tall
youth. &#8220;There&#8217;s only one Solomon in the
family. Is this the little Parlin girl? What
are you doing down this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Solly, Solly,&#8221; gasped Dotty; and then
her strength failed, and she sank at his feet.</p>

<p>Of course Tate did not keep up another
second after that, but fell across Dotty with
a smothered groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s pretty doings!&#8221; thought Enoch;
&#8220;two little young ones froze to death, and
no house in sight! What were their folks
thinking of, to let &#8217;em out in such a trimmer
of a storm? None o&#8217; <em>my</em> business; much as
I can do to take care o&#8217; myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Enoch had a heart, after all, and could
not leave the children to perish. He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Tate in his arms, she being the lighter of
the two, and, as he could see, the fainter-hearted,
and bade Dotty follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said she, feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! yes, you can, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty did not rise.</p>

<p>This would never do. Enoch held up
Tate with his left hand, and with his right
raised Dotty and shook her fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now come along,&#8221; said he; &#8220;if you don&#8217;t,
I&#8217;ll call the dog.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i119.jpg" width="600" height="408" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Friend in Need.</span>&mdash;<a href="#Page_112">Page 112</a>.</div>
</div>

<p>Dotty roused at once. Enoch&#8217;s words
scattered the mist which was spreading over
her thoughts, just as his mother&#8217;s scolding
scattered the cobwebs from the rafters.
Dotty found she was not dead yet, and,
more than that, she was not going to allow
herself to be killed by a dog that belonged
to the Rosenberg family. So she clung to
Enoch, and struggled on. She hardly knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
whether it was hours or minutes, for time
was in a blur, like everything else; but by
and by they came to a house.</p>

<p>Enoch walked in without knocking. A
woman, with a baby in her arms, cried out,
&#8220;Mercy on us!&#8221; dropped the baby into a
cradle, and, seizing Tate, began to pull off
her hood and cloak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fly round, Martha Jane,&#8221; said she to
her daughter; &#8220;take the other one, and rub
her hands as quick as you can! Susan Ellen,
fetch the camphor-bottle! Where did
these children come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>And without waiting for an answer, she
ran for hot water and ginger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drink this,&#8221; said she, coming back with
a steaming bowl, whose contents she stirred
with a spoon. She was almost obliged to
open the little girls&#8217; mouths before she could
make them swallow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, mother,&#8221; said Martha Jane, tearfully,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you remember the lamb I told you
about last year, at uncle Sam&#8217;s? how stiff
its little jaws were? We had to hold them
apart, just this way, to pour down pepper
tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty looked up at the big girl in a green
dress with a foolish smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I a little sheep?&#8221; thought she, and
closed her eyes.</p>

<p>She felt somebody tucking her into a
warm bed. Her clothes had been removed,
and there were nice blankets and shawls
wrapped about her from head to foot. Then
she fancied she was a baby with a purple
face, dying of whooping-cough. That there
was such a little girl as Tate Penny, she
had quite forgotten. And Tate, who lay
near her, had forgotten all about Dotty,
and her own unfortunate nose. Mrs. Harris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
stood watching them with enough motherly
kindness in her heart to have warmed
them, body and soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless the little dears, they look all right
now, and will be asleep in two minutes; but
I assure you, Martha Jane, I thought, when
they first came in, it was a pretty hard
chance; they wouldn&#8217;t have stood it out
doors much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Enoch was waiting in the next room. He
was glad to hear the children were doing so
well; but he did not say so, and hurried
away with a cross face, as if he had already
wasted a great deal of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call at Mrs. Parlin&#8217;s without fail,&#8221; said
Mrs. Harris, &#8220;or else at the school-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good two miles to either place,&#8221;
grumbled Enoch; &#8220;and it isn&#8217;t exactly summer
weather, you&#8217;d better believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, but their folks must be told where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
they are!&#8221; persisted Mrs. Harris. &#8220;Do go&mdash;there&#8217;s
a good boy! I&#8217;ve nobody but girls,
and can&#8217;t send!&#8221;</p>

<p>Enoch slammed the door after him, leaving
kind Mrs. Harris in a fever of uncertainty
whether he meant to go to Mr.
Parlin&#8217;s or not.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">A LONG NIGHT.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. Parlin found it very hard to push
his way through the drifts, with the storm
beating on all sides, and every snow-flake
pricking like a needle. He thought of Ben
Penny, and was almost afraid the sick lad
would perish. It seemed to make very little
difference which direction he took, since one
was as likely to be right as another. As he
was going down Congress Street, some one
touched his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, sir; be you Mr. Parlin?&#8221;</p>

<p>Enoch Rosenberg had spent several years
with a farmer in the backwoods, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
not talk very correctly. &#8220;The school-mistress
says you&#8217;re round after that little girl
o&#8217; yourn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; what do you know of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve come to tell you she&#8217;s safe and
sound, and t&#8217;other little one too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure? Is it true? Where are
they? Speak quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Mr. Harris&#8217;s&mdash;two miles off&mdash;no,
considerable scant of two miles&mdash;down yonder.
They&#8217;d have been as dead as door-nails,
both of &#8217;em, if I hadn&#8217;t happened to
have catched up with &#8217;em. One of &#8217;em, she
hollered out to me, and then they fell down,
one top o&#8217; the other, as near froze as ever
you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how do you know they are safe now;
tell me that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I took &#8217;em to Mr. Harris&#8217;s; that&#8217;s how I
know. I had to scold considerable sharp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and make believe I&#8217;se going to set a dog on
&#8217;em, afore I could bring &#8217;em to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin drew his hand across his eyes.
He could not bear to think his tender child
had been in such horrible danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, my young friend?&#8221;
said he, offering his hand to Enoch; &#8220;and
how did you know me? Call round to my
office to-morrow; I want to see you again.
This is not the time or place to thank you
as you deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Enoch&#8217;s black eyes glittered. He understood
that Mr. Parlin meant to give him
some money, and this was just what he had
expected, for he remembered the liberal reward
bestowed on his mother for taking care
of Dotty a day or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied he, thinking, &#8220;he&#8217;ll
come down with something handsome! I
ain&#8217;t a mite afraid but he will. Guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I wouldn&#8217;t a&#8217; taken this tramp for nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin hastened to Mrs. Penny. He
found her pacing the floor, and staring
straight before her with fixed eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good news,&#8221; said he; &#8220;the children are
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Penny screamed as if he had struck
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe,&#8221; repeated he; &#8220;they are at Mrs.
Harris&#8217;s. I know the woman&mdash;one of the
kindest souls living.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Penny screamed again, and wrung
her hands. Mr. Parlin feared she was losing
her reason; but very soon tears began to
flow, and the weight on her brain gave way.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can rest easy,&#8221; said Mr. Parlin,
&#8220;I do not think it will be best to bring the
children home to-day. After this great fright
and exposure, they need rest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, no; don&#8217;t go for them,&#8221; cried Mrs.
Penny. &#8220;I beg you won&#8217;t go for them; I
can&#8217;t have my little Tate face such a storm
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin turned to open the door; but
Mrs. Penny was too excited to stop talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only think of my letting her go to school
to-day! She said to me, &#8216;O, ma, I must
go; for Dotty Dimple and I have an engagement!&#8217;
She thinks there&#8217;s nobody like
Dotty Dimple!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin turned the knob, but Mrs.
Penny continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child came home one night very
much agitated, and wanted to know why I
didn&#8217;t make her be good, like Dotty Dimple.
I told her I couldn&#8217;t; she must try for
herself. &#8216;But, ma,&#8217; said she, &#8216;you ought to
pray to me, and make me be good; that&#8217;s
what Dotty Dimple&#8217;s mother does to her!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Dotty says, if our Nancy put her to bed, she
shouldn&#8217;t be any better&#8217;n me!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our little daughter thinks very well of
herself,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and that is the most discouraging
thing about her. Good by, Mrs.
Penny. To-morrow, as soon as the storm
is over, I will go for the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good by, sir; and send my boy back, if
you find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good by, thir,&#8221; said a little dumpling of
a girl, called Tid, peeping out from behind
the closet door.</p>

<p>&#8220;My precious Tate,&#8221; thought Mrs. Penny,
earnestly; &#8220;if I ever get her home again, I
will take more pains with her. I presume
Nancy doesn&#8217;t hear her say her prayers half
the time. She seems inclined to tell wrong
stories lately; who knows but I could break
up the habit, if, as Dotty Dimple says, I put
her to bed myself?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Parlin overtook Ben Penny, and
helped him home. By that time he longed
for shelter: but how could he rest until he
had seen for himself that Dotty was safe?
The Rosenberg boy had no doubt intended
to tell the truth, but there might be some
mistake; so the anxious father went all the
way to Mr. Harris&#8217;s, and, when he arrived
there, found the children fast asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do stay and rest yourself, sir,&#8221; said Mrs.
Harris. &#8220;You look as if you couldn&#8217;t walk
another step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied Mr. Parlin; &#8220;an
hour&#8217;s rest would be very welcome; but I
dare not take it; it is growing late.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tired man set out again. By the time
he reached home, he was so exhausted that
he could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear husband, what is the
matter?&#8221; said Mrs. Parlin; &#8220;and where is
Dotty?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Safe,&#8221; replied Mr. Parlin from the depths
of a sofa pillow, &#8220;safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, at Mrs. Harris&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Mrs. Harris&#8217;s, Edward? What is
she doing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Having a good nap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleeping at this time of day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; you see she got thoroughly chilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chilled?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she and that Penny child lost their
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost their way? When? Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going from the school-house to Mrs.
Penny&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prudy was excessively amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, papa, the road isn&#8217;t any longer&#8217;n
my little finger!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this snow, my dear, is a great deal
deeper than your finger. I fear we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hear of sad accidents, for it will prove one
of the worst storms ever known in New England.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a fearful night. The wind shrieked
and rattled the windows, and shook the
storm-door. One would have thought a legion
of wretched, starving beggars were
prowling about the house, pleading to be
let in. And still it was nothing but the
wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish my children were all at home,&#8221;
sighed Mrs. Parlin, every time the shrieks
wakened her. &#8220;I know Mrs. Harris will take
good care of Dotty; but I don&#8217;t like to have
my little girl away from me on such a night
as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same time Dotty Dimple was lying
in a room whose walls were papered so
strangely, that she thought the pictures kept
her awake even in the dark. A boy pumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
water for some cows&mdash;she wondered
why the water didn&#8217;t freeze; and a lady
&#8220;jumping the rope with a shawl.&#8221; Then the
bedstead had very high posts, with a ball
stuck upon every one, like a head on a pin.</p>

<p>&#8220;People do have such queer things in their
houses that it keeps me awake,&#8221; thought
Dotty, who had been asleep most of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s Tate, now&mdash;nothing keeps
her awake. I wish she was; but I don&#8217;t
dare touch her for fear she&#8217;ll have the nose-bleed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind seized the house between its
teeth and shook it.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, my!&#8221; thought Dotty, &#8220;where are we
going to? S&#8217;pose this house should blow to
Europe, and my father&#8217;s house should blow
to Boston! But there needn&#8217;t anybody think
I can help it, for I can&#8217;t. It wasn&#8217;t running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
away. Miss Parker said we might; and I
don&#8217;t s&#8217;pect my papa knows this minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty was so homesick that Mrs. Harris
had not mentioned her father&#8217;s visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Solly Rosenbug, that&#8217;s called something
else,&mdash;I&#8217;ve forgot his name,&mdash;he won&#8217;t
remember to tell him. My father&#8217;ll have to
print me in the papers. &#8216;My daughter
Alice, with a calico wrapper on. Have you
seen her? Little pockets in, and a pair of
red mittens.&#8217; Nobody has ever seen me, the
snow was so thick; and when they are so
scared they can&#8217;t speak a word, then I shall
get there; but not go through the cellar
window, though, &#8217;cause I didn&#8217;t run away,
and couldn&#8217;t help it. I was doing just right.</p>

<p>&#8220;How they&#8217;ll feel! And what&#8217;s the first
words grandma&#8217;ll say? I know. She always
says &#8217;em after I&#8217;ve had a dreadful time, and
didn&#8217;t get drowned, or die,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He gave his angels a <em>charger of</em>, concerning
thee.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what she means by an &#8216;angel
a charger of.&#8217; P&#8217;r&#8217;aps &#8217;twill be Solly
Rosenbug, she means; but she don&#8217;t know
how he looks, or she wouldn&#8217;t call <em>him</em> an
angel!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a long night to Dotty. For the
endless space of two hours she lay sad and
homesick, thinking how dreary it was without
her mother. In the morning the storm
was past; but the wind, which had not slept
a wink all night, started up as fresh as ever.
When Dotty looked out of the window, there
lay the world, all dead and buried, nothing
to be seen but mounds of snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;The streets are gone,&#8221; said Dotty, &#8220;and
everything else. You could ride top o&#8217; the
houses, and not know the difference. The
trees look as if they were sound asleep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
being rocked, with their night-caps on.
Horses sleep standing up; so do trees,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother didn&#8217;t sleep,&#8221; said Tate. &#8220;I
know she must a&#8217; laid awake and cried. She
can&#8217;t eat a speck o&#8217; breakfast, and Nancy&#8217;ll
bring her some toast in bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mamma never eats in bed,&#8221; said
Dotty; &#8220;she doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s proper; but
she&#8217;ll look paler&#8217;n your mother does, for I&#8217;m
her youngest child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think my mother didn&#8217;t love me
as well as she did Tid?&#8221; asked Tate, in an
injured tone, tracing a little rivulet with
her finger-nail on the frosted pane.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, dear! I don&#8217;t care how much she loves
you, Tate, if my father&#8217;d only come and take
me home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up, children,&#8221; said Mrs. Harris;
&#8220;he&#8217;ll be here soon; just as soon as the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
can cut a road through the drifts. Now
come and eat your breakfasts, dears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She heard what you said, Tate Penny!
You always talk so loud!&#8221; whispered Dotty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">SAFE AT HOME.</span></h2>


<p>It was nearly noon before Mr. Parlin could
go for the children. Dotty was received at
home as joyfully as if she had been gone on
a long journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss me all you&#8217;re going to, Prudy,&#8221; said
she, as she sat in her mother&#8217;s lap, with her
sisters kneeling before her, &#8220;&#8217;cause, when
you&#8217;ve kissed me enough, I want to put some
<em>canther ice</em> on my lips, the wind has scorched
&#8217;em so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s splendid that you didn&#8217;t freeze,&#8221; said
Susy; &#8220;but what is the reason you are always
getting into such awful fixes, Dotty
Dimple?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Dotty sat upright and looked down on
Susy with an air of injured innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t <em>my</em> fix this time, Susy Parlin;
it was Tate Penny&#8217;s. And do you think my
conscience pricks? No, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, no,&#8221; said Prudy, quickly; &#8220;it is so
different&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was about to add, &#8220;from running
away,&#8221; but checked herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Prudy, I didn&#8217;t run away this time,
truly; I <em>blowed</em> away. Why, I couldn&#8217;t
have helped it, mamma, not if I&#8217;d been the
mayor, and &#8217;bliged to put myself in the lock-up
for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear; we understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever sit in my own
mother&#8217;s lap again. I gave up, and my head
went tipside over. Then Solly Rosenbug
said he&#8217;d set the dog on me. There wasn&#8217;t
any dog! I shouldn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d talk so to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
froze girl&mdash;should you? that never did a
thing, only hold on to his jacket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, dear,&#8221; said grandma Read, chafing
Dotty&#8217;s hands, &#8220;through the mercy of God,
the boy saved thy life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose so,&#8221; said Dotty, solemnly; &#8220;was
he an angel <em>a charger of</em>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does thee mean, Alice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m, I didn&#8217;t s&#8217;pose he was; I knew he
wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty hastened to change the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandma&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m a <em>nidiot</em>,&#8221; she reflected,
&#8220;to call <em>him</em> an angel, with a comforter
on, and fibbed about a dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma, what is the sky made of, that
makes it so blue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What we call the sky, Dotty, is only
atmosphere, or air. I cannot explain it to
you; it seems blue because it is so far
away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that was what made <em>me</em> so &#8216;blue&#8217;
last night, &#8217;cause <em>I</em> was so far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; said Susy; &#8220;it&#8217;s nonsense for
such a little girl as you are to talk about the
&#8216;blues.&#8217; If you have them so much, I&#8217;m
afraid they&#8217;ll settle in your nose, and you&#8217;ll
be a &#8216;Blue Nose,&#8217; like Norah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, what did Norah say when I didn&#8217;t
come home? I&#8217;m going out to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Norah,&#8221; cried Dotty, bursting into the
kitchen, &#8220;you never came in to ask if I was
froze to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>Norah set down her flat-iron and kissed
the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I know for sure you wasn&#8217;t last
night, when your father came home and told
us? And wouldn&#8217;t it have broke my heart
if you&#8217;d died in the storm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it, though, Norah? Then your
heart must be hard; a soft one couldn&#8217;t
break!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, Miss Dimple, you&#8217;re the first
one ever told me my heart was hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn your face round, Norah. Why,
&#8217;tisn&#8217;t blue; the end of it&#8217;s red!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s red?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your nose. I <em>thought</em> it wasn&#8217;t blue!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty talk that is, now,&#8221; exclaimed Norah,
angrily. &#8220;If mother and I had come
straight from Ireland, it&#8217;s Paddies we&#8217;d be.
But if we stopped in Nova Scotie, it&#8217;s Blue
Noses; and that&#8217;s all the manners there is
in this country, for sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty was rather glad to have made a
sensation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;cause your mother is so far away,
Norah; that&#8217;s why they say her nose is so
blue, like the sky up there. I cannot explain
it to you, but that&#8217;s the reason why.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norah&#8217;s little flash of temper died out in
a laugh. She would not allow herself to be
angry with such a simple little child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about noses,&#8221; said she, pleasantly.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s something I baked for you
this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a little custard pie, with a delicate
surface of sugar frosting.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, thank you, ever so much! I&#8217;ll never
call your nose blue again. Your mother&#8217;s
is, but yours isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty skipped away to show the pie to her
sisters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Norah wouldn&#8217;t have made it if I&#8217;d run
away. Nobody blames me this time; how
can they, Prudy, when I did just right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Little thrills of exceeding joy danced
through and through Dotty&#8217;s heart. It was
so seldom she got into trouble when she
&#8220;wasn&#8217;t to blame,&#8221; and could say she had
done &#8220;just right&#8221;!</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you find in that paper that interests
you so much, my dear?&#8221; said her father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
as he saw her eagerly spelling out the
advertisements in the Portland Press.</p>

<p>Dotty did not reply at once. She did not
like to confess that she had been looking for
her own name, &#8220;Alice Parlin, a little girl
with a red calico wrapper, and little pockets
in.&#8221; But no such name appeared. There
seemed to be very much said about silk, and
soap, and lard, and nails; but nothing at all
concerning two little girls who had lost their
way in the storm. Dotty concluded the
mayor had not heard of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you know all your letters,
Alice?&#8221; said Mr. Parlin, quite amused by
her earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, papa, what an idea! When I&#8217;ve
known them for years and years, and been
to school in the <em>primary&#8217;s</em> department in the
First Reader up to the head three times!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, my dear!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Dotty thought she would give her father a
proof that she could read.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa,&#8221; said she, looking up from the
newspaper, with quite a grown-up expression
of face, &#8220;who is <em>Scat</em>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Scat?</em> What do you mean, Alice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, there&#8217;s a man in this paper called
<em>Scat</em>, and it&#8217;s such a funny name, I wanted
to know where he lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty passed the Press to her father,
pointing to some votes in a recent election.
&#8220;Jones 110, Fling 106, Scat. 45.&#8221; &#8220;<em>Scat.</em>
does not mean any one in particular,&#8221; said
Mr. Parlin, laughing; &#8220;it merely stands for
&#8216;scattering.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it <em>said</em> Scat.,&#8221; returned Dotty, indignantly.</p>

<p>She had expected her father to express
some surprise at her progress in reading.
She would be careful next time, and choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a better newspaper; the Portland Press said
one thing when it meant another.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin thought Dotty was not well
enough to go to school that afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what Miss Parker&#8217;ll think,&#8221;
said the child; &#8220;she always looks to see if
<em>I</em> am there.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dotty was not at all sorry to be sitting
between her mother and her grandmother,
making a book-mark, while the
wind whistled at the windows, and the fire
glowed in the grate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t try to get in here, old
Wind,&#8221; said she, shaking her sampler fiercely;
&#8220;you can&#8217;t get through the double windows!
O, mamma, it doesn&#8217;t seem much
as it did yesterday, with me a-blowing to
which ways, and thought I shouldn&#8217;t live to
get home&mdash;hadn&#8217;t any h-o-p-e,&#8221; added she,
quoting from her book-mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We will try to be very thankful you
were spared,&#8221; said Mrs. Parlin, kissing the
earnest little face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thee could easily have died,&#8221; said.
Mrs. Read; &#8220;but the Lord willed it otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty held her needle in the air, and looked
into the coals. There was a picture there of
a white snow-storm, and two little girls lying
dead, like the babes in the wood, with only
the storm to wrap them in chilly sheets of
snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we could have tipped over and died
very easy,&#8221; thought she, with a shudder;
&#8220;but it wasn&#8217;t best; so a boy came and
saved us. But,&#8221; said she, aloud, &#8220;I guess
he didn&#8217;t know God sent him, or he wouldn&#8217;t
have dared whistle a lie with his mouth,
when there wasn&#8217;t a bit of a dog to whistle
to.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandma looked into the coals, and said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what she wants to say,&#8221; thought
Dotty. &#8220;God saved me to purpose; and He
wouldn&#8217;t have saved me to purpose if He
didn&#8217;t s&#8217;pect I was going to be a good girl.
And I mean to; O, yes, I mean to. I&#8217;ll try
harder&#8217;n ever I tried before. No tempers
I&#8217;m not going to have, and no anything that&#8217;s
naughty, and always put it in my prayers to
ask if I needn&#8217;t grow better every minute;
and then I truly shall! You don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose
He&#8217;d hear and not pay &#8217;tention? No; He
always pays &#8217;tention, and likes to have us
ask such questions as that; mother says so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty plodded away at her book-mark,
going to her mother with every stitch, or
now and then venturing to make one of her
own, which always had to be pulled out.
But it was finished at last, and Prudy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
pleased with the present, only there was a
slight mistake in the motto, and it read,
&#8220;Hope on, <em>hop</em> ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to tell you to hop,&#8221; said
Dotty; &#8220;I left out an &#8216;e;&#8217; &#8217;twas a mistake,
there were so many e&#8217;s; but I <em>do</em> know how
to spell, Prudy Parlin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, yes, little sister; Miss Parker says
you learn very fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Prudy, did you see her to-day; and
what did she say about me and Tate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She feels dreadfully, Dotty; the tears
came to her eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did, Prudy? Well, I should think
they would. Letting two little things like
us lose <em>ourself</em>! Wasn&#8217;t it awful? She&#8217;ll
kiss me when I go back to school, and she&#8217;ll
want to give me pep&#8217;mints and taffy; but it
wouldn&#8217;t be polite right before the other
girls. She&#8217;ll only say, &#8216;I&#8217;m glad to see our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
dear little Dotty back again, and Tate, too,&#8217;
says she, &#8216;and you may sit together if you
like, and just whisper the whole living
time!&#8217; That&#8217;s what she&#8217;ll say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, she won&#8217;t, either, Dotty; you musn&#8217;t
think of such a thing,&#8221; laughed Prudy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">BOSOM FRIENDS.</span></h2>


<p>Dotty did not go to school again until the
next Monday. Miss Parker kissed her affectionately,
and said, she should never
forgive herself for her thoughtlessness;
which was very gratifying to Dotty.</p>

<p>At recess Miss Parker called both the
little girls up to her, and asked for the history
of their &#8220;blowing away.&#8221; Dotty gave
it with delight, and whenever her breath
failed, Tate added a word of her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;If her nose hadn&#8217;t bled that time, Miss
Parker, we were going to ask you something.
Mayn&#8217;t we sit together? &#8217;Cause Tate likes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
me, and she don&#8217;t like Dice Prosser; <em>do</em> you,
Tate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; replied Tate, timidly; &#8220;but
I don&#8217;t hate her near so bad as you do Lina
Rosenberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I don&#8217;t hate anybody,&#8221; said Dotty,
virtuously; &#8220;only I asked my mother which
she wanted me to sit with, and she said
&#8216;Tate,&#8217; if you&#8217;re perfectly willing, Miss Parker.
Tate doesn&#8217;t <em>betwitch</em> me, and I&#8217;m not
afraid to have her sit next to my pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no objection to your changing
your seats,&#8221; said Miss Parker, smiling; &#8220;but
I wish you to remember, children, that I
have a great deal of care, and if you love
me you will try to be quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we will&mdash;won&#8217;t we, Tate?&#8221; said Dotty,
joyfully, as they moved their books. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
be better girls, &#8217;cause, don&#8217;t you know, we
were saved to purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Dotty was as good as her word. She
could not always keep her little tongue still;
but on the whole, she tried so hard to do
right, that Miss Parker loved her better and
better every day.</p>

<p>The two little seat-mates were becoming
&#8220;bosom friends.&#8221; Tate regarded Dotty as
a superior being, and Miss Dimple was quite
willing to be looked up to and copied.
Much of their time out of school was spent
in printing letters to each other, of which
this is a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Deer Tait</span>:<br />
</p>

<p><em>Jhonnie cald</em> Me <em>todelkins</em>. One time
Flierway put a pertater onter the Kerryseen
Kan, onter the nose. kiss tid for Me.</p>

<p class="center">
Truely yours,<br />
<span class="smcap leftpadding">Alice Parlin</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter was the longest one Dotty had
ever written. It cost her an hour&#8217;s patient
labor, and just as she was folding it carefully
in the shape of a diamond, Prudy tipped the
inkstand over it, and almost &#8220;blotted it out
forever.&#8221; Dotty was about to scold, but
stopped to count ten, and then said, with
almost a smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter. You didn&#8217;t spoil anything but
the &#8216;Toddlekins,&#8217; and that was so crooked I
was &#8217;shamed of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Dotty hung the letter on the clothes
line to dry, while her heart danced for
joy because she had been so patient with
Prudy.</p>

<p>But one morning Tate did not appear at
school, and to Miss Dimple&#8217;s great grief,
the following note was given her by Ben
Penny:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Darling Dotty</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>I canot set with you enny more. Ime going
to my mothers arnts scholl. The one
that the mice eat up her cows. Good by.</p>

<p class="center">
Verry truley,<br />
<span class="smcap leftpadding">Sarah Penny</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Dotty sat for a whole minute with her
head on her hand. She could not remember
about this queer &#8220;arnt,&#8221; though Tate
had described all her relatives, and, without
doubt, this one among the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mice ate up her cows! It must be very
great mice, or else very tinty cows!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the sad fact that Tate was going to
another school made Dotty as lonesome as
a widowed dove. She was obliged to go
round to Mrs. Penny&#8217;s that night to talk
about it; she told her mother she &#8220;couldn&#8217;t
live if she didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, mamma,&#8221; cried she, as soon as she
returned, &#8220;I do wish you&#8217;d let me go to that
dear little school! It&#8217;s Tate&#8217;s aunt&#8217;s mother,
and she keeps cows and mice, and it&#8217;s such a
dear little school!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about the lady,
Dotty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Tate told me all about her. She
wears one of these hair things you call a
wig, and a cap right on over it; and to-morrow&#8217;s
Wednesday, no school in the afternoon;
but her aunt&#8217;s mother has it all day,
and afterwards going to show &#8217;em the sheeps
and camp-meetings. And wants to know if
I can go&mdash;there&#8217;s little boys, too&mdash;with my
red dress on, and stay to Tate&#8217;s house to tea&mdash;if
you don&#8217;t care and perfectly willing.
&#8217;Cause it&#8217;s a dear little school!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty caught her breath, and went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;She wants me to go all the time, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
go to Miss Parker, Tate does. The woman&#8217;s
real good, and prays in school with her
eyes wide open. That&#8217;s so she can see the
little boys and little girls when they&#8217;re
doing naughty, and gets up and shakes &#8217;em,
and then she goes to praying again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t want to go to such a school
as that,&#8221; said Prudy.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, she doesn&#8217;t shake &#8217;em, &#8217;thout they
need to be shook; she&#8217;s a <em>good</em> woman, and
lets &#8217;em eat gingerbread in school.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin said Dotty might go just once,
and see how she liked it. So, the next afternoon,
she set out with Tate for &#8220;the dear
little school.&#8221; As they skipped along swinging
each other by the hand, they were met
by Johnny. Dotty began to hurry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Dot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! When you coming
back?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;When I return!&#8221;</p>

<p>After which pert reply Dotty tossed her
head, and swung Tate along upon the full run.</p>

<p>A flash of anger rose to Johnny&#8217;s eyes.
He and his little cousin had not had a quarrel
since the Crystal Wedding, and he was
starting for his aunt Mary&#8217;s, to make an afternoon
visit. Dotty saw the flash, and it
set her thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> wouldn&#8217;t want to go with me and Tate
to where I wasn&#8217;t wanted! But Johnny does!
But, then, he said he wouldn&#8217;t quarrel, &#8217;thout
I begun it, and <em>I</em> won&#8217;t begin it. I&#8217;ll stop
throwing my head back, &#8217;cause that always
makes the tempers come.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was learning to watch the lion in her
bosom. When he began to shake his mane,
she said, &#8220;Lie down, sir.&#8221; It was the only
way; after he had really got upon his feet,
and begun to rage, Dotty couldn&#8217;t stop him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Tate,&#8221; said she, sweetly, &#8220;are you willing
Johnny should go too? For I spect you
want to; don&#8217;t you, Johnny?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a small sacrifice, and Dotty thought
she was well repaid, when her cousin, with
the greatest good humor, whipped a paper
bag out of his pocket, and began to scatter
about figs, and candy, and jujube paste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll go to school with you,&#8221; said
Johnny; &#8220;but who is Mrs. Piper? Peter&#8217;s
wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead, her husband is,&#8221; replied
Tate. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what his name was.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">&#8220;THE DEAR LITTLE SCHOOL.&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>Mrs. Piper lived in a white cottage which
nestled all summer under a woodbine; but
there was no woodbine now, and the strips
of red leather, which had held it up, were left
sticking here and there by nails, and looked
frightfully like caterpillars. There was a
yard before the house, and in it were two
or three hen-coops, half buried in snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;She keeps &#8217;em in the back room, in the
winter,&#8221; said Tate, referring to the chickens.</p>

<p>Tate opened the door, and was greeted by
a black cat, and then by a gray one. A
yellow kitten sprang out upon Johnny, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
hen, with a lame leg bound up in a rag,
pecked at Dotty&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do crazy folks live here?&#8221; muttered
Johnny.</p>

<p>Tate fumbled at the latch of the sitting-room
door, but could not lift it, and
it was opened from within by Mrs. Piper&mdash;a
woman so fat and queer that Dotty concluded
it must be Peter&#8217;s mother, and she
had eaten the whole &#8220;peck of peppers&#8221; at a
meal. Her cheeks were the color of peppers,
and her false hair, which was very
false indeed, had fallen down from the top
of her forehead and drifted round to one
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, my pretty pets?&#8221; said
she to the three visitors, and stroked Dotty&#8217;s
face with her hand, which had an old kid
glove on it without any fingers.</p>

<p>The room was not very large for a school-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
There were only ten scholars in it,
and they all seemed to feel quite at home;
but Dotty looked in vain for the gingerbread.
There was a little earthen tea-pot on the
air-tight stove, also a flat-iron.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a queer school!&#8221; thought she; for
the hens in the back room cackled so loud as
to drown the voice of a little girl reading.
Mrs. Piper saw Dotty laugh behind Johnny&#8217;s
shoulder, and she laughed too.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;m a funny old woman,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;because I keep hens in the shed; but
it&#8217;s a very warm place for &#8217;em, dear. When
I had little boys of my own, I didn&#8217;t keep
cats and hens; but now my little boys are
all gone, and I want something to love&mdash;do
you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Dotty, very sorry Mrs.
Piper&#8217;s boys were all gone, but thinking
that did not make the cats and hens any the
less funny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The reason I want little children to come
to my school is, because my hens and cats
can&#8217;t talk to me, and sometimes I am lonesome.
I teach my scholars to be good,&#8221; said
she, turning to shake a little girl for snapping
apple-seeds; &#8220;that is better than book-learning.
I am talking to them to-day about
truth. Do you always tell the truth, little
dear?&#8221; said she to Dotty, so abruptly that
Dotty found it hard to keep from laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes I don&#8217;t, m&#8217;m; &#8217;most always
I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, little dear; that&#8217;s right. A
lie is an abomination; do you see? Can you
say the word?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A-bommer-nation,&#8221; repeated Dotty.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;An abomination to the Lord.&#8217; That
means He hates it. Now, if you ever
feel as if you wanted to tell a lie, will you
stop long enough to say &#8216;abomination&#8217; three
times?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>All</em>, answer me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; cried the children in chorus,
looking up from their paper balls, and
paper boats, and picture-books.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, little dears,&#8221; said Mrs Piper;
and then she waddled away to hear a
class of one boy in arithmetic. After this
she told the children to study their spelling
lessons; and while they were doing so she
looked around with a satisfied smile, and
taking the tea-pot off the stove, and filling it,
began to water the plants in the windows.</p>

<p>Dotty bit her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are those roses in the big bowls <em>tea</em>-roses?&#8221;
thought she. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of such
a kind, but I didn&#8217;t know &#8217;twas tea that made
them so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plants were in cups, and saucers, and
basins, and everything else but flower-pots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
There was a dew-plant in an iron kettle,
spattered all over with little red blossoms,
&#8220;like the measles,&#8221; Dotty thought. &#8220;And
the <em>caltycus</em> had something else the matter,
for it was covered with little white pimples.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the good lady had helped her forty
plants to a cup of tea all around, it was time
to hear the lessons. Tate was delighted to
show the silver medal which hung from her
neck by a blue ribbon, and was a sign that
she stood at the head of her spelling class.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now school is done,&#8221; said Mrs. Piper,
settling her false hair; &#8220;and as you&#8217;ve been
pretty good children for the last four weeks,
I suppose you all want to see my pictures?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <em>ma&#8217;am</em>,&#8221; cried the children, Johnny
loudest of all.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t what everybody would call pictures,&#8221;
said Mrs. Piper, opening the bureau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
drawers in the entry, while no less than four
cats sprang upon her, and playfully tried to
assist her in taking out her treasures.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <em>I</em> shouldn&#8217;t call them pictures,&#8221;
thought Dotty, as Mrs. Piper held them so
high that she saw nothing but a rough, dark
surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks to me like hemlock bark,&#8221; thought
Johnny, and decided at once that he had been
right in the first place, and the woman was
certainly crazy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Piper set the pictures on a table. A
murmur of surprise arose from the lips of
Johnny and Dotty.</p>

<p>&#8220;A camp-meeting, little dears,&#8221; explained
Mrs. Piper, pointing to several wee tents
made of white cloth, and spread around on
the smooth surface of the bark, which had
been covered with moss to imitate grass.
There were sprigs of evergreen stuck in for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
trees; and here and there a bit of broken
looking-glass served for a brook. But the
men and women formed the most attractive
part of the scene. These were little rag
babies as long as your finger, dressed for
church; the men in long-tailed coats and
stove-pipe hats, the women in gowns of all
colors, and bonnets trimmed with tiny
feathers, or very narrow taste. The preachers
stood outside the tents, holding little
things in their hands which Mrs. Piper said
were hymn-books and Bibles, though they
looked like bits of paper. The preachers
were looking at the hymns with their little
beads of eyes, and reading them aloud with
their red worsted mouths. The men and
women who seemed to be doing nothing at
all but try to keep from tipping over, were
actually singing, only the music, like the
rippling of the looking-glass brooks, was so
very low that it couldn&#8217;t be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that man with the red
cheeks? It was whiskey did it; but I stuck
a pin in my finger, and rubbed on a little
blood. He is singing, &#8216;Happy day! Happy
day!&#8217; After his sins were washed away
he never drank any more. His name was
John Peck; he was my brother. Little boys,
I hope you will never drink!</p>

<p>&#8220;This man with the red shirt on was my
husband; he was a sea captain; and one day
his ship sank, and then I was a widow. Little
girls, I hope you&#8217;ll never be widows!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty hid behind Johnny&#8217;s shoulder again.
Mrs. Piper went on to the next picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Ruth and <em>Boze</em>,&#8221; said she, meaning
<em>Boaz</em>, &#8220;Did you ever read the story of
Ruth? how she wouldn&#8217;t leave Naomi? that&#8217;s
her mother-in-law. A good girl Ruth was,
and a pretty girl. That is her apron she is
holding up in her hands. I don&#8217;t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
whether they made &#8217;em with ruffles in those
days or not; but the spears sticking out of
it is wheat; she has picked it up in the field.
And there is <em>Boze</em>; he is rich, for you see the
gold on his coat-tail. And there&#8217;s Naomi,
that Ruth loved. Do you love your own
mothers, little girls, and mind what they
say? I hope so. It is a beautiful story.
Ask some one to read it to you. And now,
these sheep, what <em>do</em> you think they are
made of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Dough</em>,&#8221; cried Johnny.</p>

<p>Mrs. Piper looked crestfallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how did you know that, little dear?
Yes, these sheep are made of dough; but
their backs are ridged over with a pin to
look like wool. I had sixteen, but I set &#8217;em
on the floor to dry, and the lame hen ate up
ten. I want you all to be good little children
and do right,&#8221; added the good woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
who tried to remember to put in a <em>moral</em>
every few minutes. &#8220;And now I will show
you some more things. Here is a piece of
lava; came out of a volcano&mdash;Vesuvius. Here
are some sharks&#8217; teeth, and these are whales&#8217;
teeth; and see these big sea-shells, full of the
roar of the sea that drowned my husband!</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that will do; it is growing dark.
Now, is there anything you have learned at
my school to-day, little dears?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she looked at Dotty, Dotty replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m; how to say Bommer-<em>nibble</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She means &#8216;abomination,&#8217;&#8221; corrected
Tate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. Remember, a lie is an
abomination to the Lord. And now, good
by, little dears.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, Mrs. Piper made an old-fashioned
courtesy, and waved the children out
of the room with both hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>They put on their wrappings in the hall,
and passed out, leaving the dear, queer old
lady alone with her flowers, cats, and
chickens.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;ve got far enough away so
we can laugh,&#8221; said Dotty.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; cried Johnny, &#8220;awful crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tate hurried along, and caught up with
Dotty. She had lingered behind to kiss
her auntie, and receive a seed-cake from her
cupboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I <em>say</em> it was a dear little school?&#8221;
said Tate, for she had always known and
loved her aunt Piper, and did not think how
odd the dear woman must seem to a stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&mdash;s,&#8221; answered Dotty, &#8220;only my face
is all burning a-fire, trying to keep from
laughing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps it&#8217;s queer,&#8221; said Tate; &#8220;but isn&#8217;t
she a darling?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Dotty did not answer, and Johnny gave
her a sly pinch on the arm, with a very
comical look about his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re going to tell your mamma
you like the school, and ask her if you
mayn&#8217;t come, so you can sit with me, Dotty
Dimple?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dotty was about to say, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll ask
her;&#8221; for she thought, &#8220;I can do it &#8217;way
down in my throat, so she&#8217;ll know I don&#8217;t
want to go&mdash;But, no; it&#8217;s wicked to deceive
Tate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to ask your mother?&#8221; repeated
Tate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bommernibble, bommernibble, bommer<em>nibble</em>!&#8221;
whispered Dotty, forgetting the
word, but remembering her promise. Then
she felt quite brave, and said aloud,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Tate; I&#8217;d like to sit with you forever
and always; but I shan&#8217;t ask my mother;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
&#8217;cause I like Miss Parker the best. Miss
Parker isn&#8217;t crazy, and she isn&#8217;t a <em>nidiot</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor my auntie isn&#8217;t, either,&#8221; said Tate,
ready to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never said she was, Tate; <em>did</em> I, Johnny?
But I don&#8217;t want to go to a school where the
hens <em>kerdahcut</em> right in the house, and they
give their flowers tea and coffee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for you, Dot Dimple!&#8221; cried
Johnny; but poor little Tate wiped off a tear
with the thumb of her mitten.</p>

<p>The end of it all was, that as Dotty would
not go to Mrs. Piper&#8217;s school, Tate left it,
and went back to Miss Parker with Dotty.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to sit together as long as we
live,&#8221; said Dotty, coming home one night in
a very happy frame of mind; &#8220;and the teacher
says we are her little comforts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only think of Dotty&#8217;s being a comfort!&#8221;
said Susy, with a curling lip; but Mrs. Parlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
looked at her oldest daughter reprovingly,
and Susy added,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you do grow better, Dotty, I declare
you do!&#8221; and kissed the child on the
forehead.</p>

<p>Praise from Susy! This was something
new! Dotty&#8217;s eyes twinkled and shone like
stars on a winter&#8217;s night.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are getting to be just like anybody
now,&#8221; said Prudy. &#8220;You can make bookmarks,
and go to school, and have vacations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; replied Dotty, with a queenly
pose of the head; &#8220;and when we go to
vacation, next summer, there won&#8217;t anybody
ask, &#8216;Is this Mrs. Parlin&#8217;s baby?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; said Prudy, consolingly.
&#8220;Flyaway will be the only baby there is at
Willowbrook next summer, and <em>she</em> is growing
up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it was next summer now,&#8221; sighed
Dotty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And it <em>will</em> be &#8220;next summer&#8221; before we
see Miss Dimple again.</p>

<p>Let us hope she may arrive at her grandfather
Parlin&#8217;s in good health and spirits,
and that we who meet her there may be as
rosy and happy as herself.</p>
